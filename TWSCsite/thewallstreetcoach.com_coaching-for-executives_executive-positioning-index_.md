## In just minutes…

- Imagine being able to unblock yourself from everything that holds you back.
- In your work and in your personal life. Poof!
- The fog lifts and you can finally see clearly.

## All your choices and decisions will be crystal clear going forward… every single time.   Here’s how…

Your success in your career has everything to do with your personal judgment and how, in the critical moment, you emotionally and intellectually respond to every stimulus.

Imagine being able to finally **control and predict** your own responses. Imagine the command you’d finally have over your career. And your happiness in life outside of work.

## Master your judgment, master your career.   Master your judgment, master your life.

Several hidden problems plague even the most successful traders:

1. Self-sabotage
2. Overconfidence
3. Fear of failure
4. Deficiencies in strategic thinking
5. Undervaluing self-care
6. Poor data analysis leading to flawed decision making

![Balance Meaningfulness](https://www.thewallstreetcoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/TableBalanceMeaningfulness-768x276.png)

If you know which of your traits and emotional responses are holding you back from making the right work and life choices, you’ll finally be able to make better decisions for yourself, your team, and improve your work and your life.

That’s because there’s a brand new tool for executives that will help you make better decisions and unlock deeper potential…

![Trader Positioning Index - Values Dial](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Your judgment is what informs every single choice you make. This is not something you have, it’s who you are. It evolves throughout your life and is influenced by every event, experience, and individual you meet.

The Executive Positioning Index measures over 70 different areas of your personal judgment structure. It exposes:

- Your strengths
- Your biases
- Your blind spots
- Your propensity to over or under work
- Your level of work ethic
- A high or low capacity for big-picture thinking
- Your problem-solving ability
- And so much more!

It’s easy to make the wrong decisions in your trading when your values are out of whack.

When you lean too heavily in one direction, it can send you racing down the wrong path – toward a destination that could leave you empty and unfulfilled.

Imagine knowing exactly what steps to take in your career to launch you toward a life filled with passion, excitement, and joy.

![Problem Solving](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

The Executive Positioning Index will shine a spotlight on every area of your career and your life. You’ll immediately see where you are out of balance so you can finally have breakthrough after breakthrough in both your work and personal life.

Based on the Nobel Prize nominated life’s work of Dr. Robert S. Hartman, this assessment is unlike any other. This is not a personality assessment, IQ test, nor an emotional balance test. The Executive Positioning Index goes to a deeper level than any traditional assessment you’ve ever taken. It identifies the values that drive every decision you make.

The Executive Positioning Index with The Wall Street Coach will give you a crystal clear view into your unique decision-making process and allow you to move forward with a world-class coach to finally amplify your strengths, identify blind spots, and build yourself up where you are weak.

Listen to Barry’s incredible Executive Positioning Index results and the shocking revelation that helped him reinvent and revitalize his business:

## “I was really shocked by the results I got.”

## Here’s what clients have to say about the   Executive Positioning Index…

**My jaw almost hit the table…**

“Kim dug deep and delivered her hour-long assessment, my jaw almost hit the table because it felt as if Kim had lived inside my head and fully understood my value system, thought process, and behavioral tendencies. And with that, Kim offered great and pragmatic insights into how I can do even better.”

**– Thuan Pham, former CTO of Uber**

* * *

**Showed me how I can minimize my weaknesses and double down on my strengths.**

“Working with the Executive Positioning Index showed me how I can minimize my weaknesses and double down on my strengths. For a trader, business owner, entrepreneur – anyone who needs to think concretely and act decisively – these are invaluable insights. I highly recommend you do this work for yourself, the results can be profound.”

**– Aaron Gentzler, Financial Publisher**

* * *

**Everyday I use the index as a quick guide to “why” I feel the way I do.**

“I recently took Kim up on taking the Executive Positioning Index. Having taken many personality profile tests before, I pretty much figured I knew everything. I wasn’t prepared for the results of the Executive Positioning Index. Kim took me through the results and gave me real clarity (for the first time) on my biggest hang ups… in a way no one has ever done so before. I shared that discovery on my many media platforms with potential clients and a large portion of them resonated with it. It not only helped me feel at ease, it also helped me close some sales because I was able to let go of the obstacles. Now, everyday, I use the index as a quick guide to “why” I feel the way I do. What needs aren’t being met, how does that connect with my dilemma, and what action do I need to take. A priceless new piece of machinery in my mental tool box. So simple to understand and take action from. I wish I had been exposed to this 5 years ago.”

**– Barry Randall, CEO of the LSC Investment Group UK**

**Added dimension to our recruiting process.**

“We had been very effective at finding people who had the experience, capabilities, and skills to be successful in these positions; however, we had been unable to predict who would find the jobs rewarding enough to stay any reasonable length of time. The Executive Positioning Index added this dimension to our recruiting process.”

**– DB, Senior Vice-President Human Resources / Leading Health Care Insurance Company**

* * *

**Key information that I was able to use to begin to improve my life.**

“I was super impressed with the high quality insights provided by the Executive Positioning Index. In particular, it provided a nuanced view of my personality, its benefits, and its challenges. Last, it provided me with key information that I was able to use to begin to improve my life.”

**– Jason Apollo Voss, CFA \| CEO, Active Investment Management (AIM) Consulting**

* * *

**This test uncovered something critical in my toolkit.**

“I have a degree in psychology and have been deeply interested in personality and behavior tests since the 70s. Most of them were at best hit-or-miss, with very little tangible insight I could use in the real world. This test, however, uncovered something critical in my toolkit that I was unconscious of — the way I immediately zoom to a “bird’s eye view” on any situation or problem, and see the ramifications of every move as if they were obvious. I thought everyone was able to see the Big Picture, but now realize that’s not true. It’s the secret sauce in my successful career, and I’m just stunned I never realized it before. So thanks Kim — any test that can uncover something so essential and important to anyone’s “professional makeup” like that is a critical step in understanding ourselves. Highly recommended.”
