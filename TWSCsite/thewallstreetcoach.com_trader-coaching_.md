Her actionable insights lead me to success
Most people will tell you that 90%+ of trading success is mental. Those same people will spend 90% of their time developing strategies without giving much thought to the mental aspect. Is it any wonder most people are not happy with their trading performance? Kim has the right background and a lifelong passion for helping others to be better. I am one of those people. Kim helps me explore areas I need to work on and provides actionable insights. If you are committed to success, take the steps to increase your odds, hire Kim!

Pulled my trader out of a slump
When one of my traders went into a long drawn out slump I reached out to Kim for help. The sessions were well worth the expense, as they paid for themself in no time. In just a few weeks she managed to help him get back to consistent profitability. His performance has continued to improve and he is back on track to being a highly successful trader. Perhaps more important were some of the intangible and unexpected benefits. Kim's advice and guidance has been impactful in some very meaningful ways. Over the next few months of coaching he transformed into a new person - his outlook and attitude have never been so positive. My only regret is not starting sooner!

My jaw almost hit the table…
“Kim dug deep and delivered her hour-long assessment, my jaw almost hit the table because it felt as if Kim had lived inside my head and fully understood my value system, thought process, and behavioral tendencies. And with that, Kim offered great and pragmatic insights into how I can do even better.”

My win-rate improved from 40% to 60%
Kim's work has changed both my trading and personal life. Through our work together I was able to find out more about myself than I ever really have on my own. In trading, as we all know the better you know yourself the better you are able to execute/perform. My win rate improved from 40% to 60% as I began to trade less and make more by focusing on the best opportunities and acknowledging FOMO when it reared its ugly head. All of the trading work and personal work are very intertwined, and my personal life also got better as I was more observant of how I was interpreting/responding to situations and events that occurred in my life.
