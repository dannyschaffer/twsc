Latoya Smith, co-founder of The Profit Room, joins Kim and Lucas to discuss her journey as a trader, some of the rules she’s developed for herself, and how she helps develop new traders into pros.

Latoya has been trading and investing for over 14 years and encourages her students to always remember ‘WHY’ they’re trading. For her, it’s financial freedom and to spend time with her kids. Her strict rules allow her to keep trading as a means to an end instead of an addiction that she can’t look away from, allowing her to stay neutral, balanced, and profitable.
