# Blog  Ray D’Argenio

“As someone relatively new to trading, I sought Kim out for support. For ten years I’ve been a professional poker player, so I understand that trading is a lot like gambling and since I am someone always looking to explore areas where an edge can be found, I’ve done extensive psychological and spiritual work on myself. Kim not only boosted my confidence to continue the path I am on, but my work with her helped to uncover some blind spots. Her gentle guidance has been invaluable to me for my journey to discover my true self. Today, the calmness and serenity I bring to trading — most mornings — is largely due to this genuine, empathic, and intelligent woman.”
