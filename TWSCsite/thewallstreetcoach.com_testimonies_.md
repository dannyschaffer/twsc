###### I am floored by the accuracy of it

"Never in a million years could I have expected this assessment to return the kinds of results and insights that it yielded. I am floored at the accuracy of it as well as the guidance it points towards. If you have not taken the Positioning Index, you seriously can’t know the areas you need to work on to improve not just in your trading, but in your life."

Gardi Armand

Trader & Business Owner

###### My trading has improved, and I feel like a HUGE weight has been lifted off my back.

"Working with Kim was like holding up a mirror I didn’t know I needed. After taking the Trader Positioning Index, Kim was able to get to the root of patterns that had been holding me back — not just professionally, but personally. I honestly didn’t think the assessment would reveal much at first, but once we reviewed the results, I was in a total WOW state.

I came in thinking I needed help with a specific challenge, and walked away with a completely new perspective on myself and my potential. Kim really drills down to the root cause, which is so important. My trading has improved, and I feel like a HUGE weight has been lifted off my back — it’s the best feeling ever.

My overall quality of life has also improved, as Kim gave me actionable steps to get back on track not just in trading, but in my personal life as well. The clarity I’ve gained has changed how I show up in my business, how I communicate, and how I lead.
Working with her was one of the most valuable decisions I’ve made. Kim is a must-do — there’s no other way to describe my experience with her."

###### It's been a game changer for me

"Kim played an early key role in identifying a lot of the false pressures I had put on myself. I had been trying to pivot my career for years as priorities had shifted in my life and my kids were growing up quickly. It helped me think in a different way, helped identify the main roadblocks in my way of change and helped take the weight off my shoulders to focus on what I needed to do. I've always had a hard shell to crack. Kim, however, was the first to crack that shell open. I have been more open to working with professionals and it's been a game changer for me finally experiencing balance for the first time in my professional career."

###### My trading performance increased to a 90% win rate

"Working with Kim has been an eye-opening and transformative experience. We started by reviewing my trading habits—what was working and what wasn’t. From there, Kim introduced me to the Trader Positioning Index. Initially, I was skeptical; as it took me only ten minutes to complete so I wasn’t expecting much from it. But I was blown away by how accurate and insightful the results were. It revealed a deep connection between my work and personal mindset, pinpointing the areas I needed to focus on. What came next was truly life-changing. Kim helped me uncover and address deep-rooted issues I had been carrying since my teenage years—issues I never realized were affecting my trading and overall performance. Through her guidance, I began to heal, and my confidence grew, not just in trading but in my role as a leader at work. The results speak for themselves. Since working with Kim, my trading performance increased to a 90% win rate over the last month and a half. For the first time, I feel like I’ve reached the light at the end of the tunnel and I’m excited to see what the coming months and years will bring. Thank you, Kim, for your incredible support and expertise. I couldn’t have done this without you!"

###### Brilliant!

"All I can say is BRILLIANT! The one word I would use to describe my experience with The Wall Street Coach, Kim Ann Curtin.

Kim had the insight, focus and expertise to clearly see any and all roadblocks and speed bumps affecting my trading world and my life. Kim was able to flip them around and turn them into strengths. She was able to help me resolve other issues by providing me with a new perspective and an increase in my self-awareness.
Kim, you are a gem and have forever changed how I look at the markets and my life! You have given me an incredible tool belt full of precise strategies that can only push me in the right direction of success in this journey of life.

Thank you so much - I am forever grateful to you."

###### I have been able to grow my account by over 135%

"After reaching out to Kim Ann Curtin and her team I began to invest in myself. I started with the Trader EQ sessions and then took the Trader Positioning Index evaluation which showed exactly where my issues were stemming from. Through continued investment in myself, I was able to rebuild my confidence and in just 6 months of this year, I have been able to grow my account by over 135%. Far exceeding my prior losses, gains, and expectations. Kim and her team are true professionals and the benefits that come from working with them go far beyond earnings and careers. If you let it, it can truly change your course in life."

###### My win rate improved from 40% to 60%

Kim's work has changed both my trading and personal life. Through our work together I was able to find out more about myself than I ever really have on my own. In trading, as we all know the better you know yourself the better you are able to execute/perform. My win rate improved from 40% to 60% as I began to trade less and make more by focusing on the best opportunities and acknowledging FOMO when it reared its ugly head. All of the trading work and personal work are very intertwined, and my personal life also got better as I was more observant of how I was interpreting/responding to situations and events that occurred in my life.

###### If you are trading as a professional, it is a MUST do.

"Kim is not only an incredible coach but an amazing person. I met Kim initially through her free live coaching sessions which turned into doing the trader assessment and 2 coaching sessions. The trader assessment is a MUST do for anyone who is curious about what is really going on "under the hood". And if you are trading as a professional, it is a MUST do. I cannot thank Kim enough for the 100% attention that she gives on live coaching sessions and in-person coaching."

###### Kim's candid feedback has been a catalyst for unlocking my potential as a leader

"Kim's superpower lies in her ability to accurately assess the blind spots that are creating challenges for leaders and her ability to give you the feedback in a direct and candid way. This unique skill and style has been impactful in my development. She doesn't shy away from addressing the tough issues, and her candid feedback has been a catalyst for unlocking my potential as a leader. Her strategies and tools have equipped me with practical skills to navigate complex situations, manage stress, lead with a direct and clear management style and inspire my team. As a result, I have seen a noticeable increase in team engagement and productivity, as well as a more positive organizational culture."

###### It's been the antidote to over trading

"Trading setups, rules and processes are absolutely critical to success. However, these are useless if one has hidden self-limiting beliefs or self-sabotaging traits. Kim pointed out a path for me to question why I am the way that I am. Just going through that reflective process has made a big difference. I am MUCH more patient and comfortable waiting for those A+ setups-and walking away if they do not present. It's been the antidote to over trading. Thanks to Kim's guidance, personal growth is now a significant, deliberate portion of my trading process. It's about more than money-it's about using trading as a tool to learn broader lessons that have an impact on myself, my family, and potentially anyone I come in contact with. In my view, trading is a fantastic, objective gauge to show evidence that I am making improvements."

###### Kim's analysis and insight is unparalleled

"I've taken a handful of personality tests in my life, and nothing compares to the EPI. The usefulness of any tool is contingent on the skill of the individual wielding it. The assessment by itself was highly informative, but the greatest impact came from Kim's ability to break down the results in the context of my roadblocks and objectives. Her analysis and insight is unparalleled and I was beyond impressed. Our consultation has been the catalyst for a much-needed transformation in my relationship to myself, my work, and my goals. I could not be more grateful that our paths crossed."

###### You get maximum benefits

"I would thoroughly recommend getting a Trader Positioning Assessment done by Kim. I found it a really insightful process which highlighted some areas to improve on when it comes to my mindset. Kim takes you through the assessment in a clear and detailed way which means you get maximum benefits. I’m really grateful to Kim and always come away from our conversations relaxed but inspired and raring to go."

###### I saw my portfolio returns jump from 5% to 30%

"I didn’t fully understand the value of having optimized hormones until I saw my portfolio returns jump from 5% to 30%. The delicate balance of hormones in the body has a massive impact on my ability to make calm, rational decisions in response to fluctuations in the market. What started with a comprehensive blood test has led to better performance in trading, in the gym, and the bedroom. Kim is one of the rare coaches out there that understands the importance of hormone health when it comes to trading effectively and sustainably."

###### My Win Rate Rocketed to 75%

"Not only has my trading turned around, but my life has too. I've been struggling with trading for 2 years and on top of that went through a divorce. My home and work life was in shambles and my stress level had never been so high. I decided to get help in my hope to find relief. Once I started working with Kim, my trading took a 180-degree turn and my win rate rocketed to 75%. I even went on a winning streak of 16 days in a row. My self-confidence has improved and my stress levels have decreased significantly. Thank you, Kim!"

###### Huge difference in my trading

"Kim's small group coaching was such a great experience. I was having some mental roadblocks and through Kim's exercises it truly helped me untangle barriers I was having. Kim has so many tools in her toolbox to help address so many different topics you might be experiencing or need help working on. I have noticed a huge difference in my trading, as well as my personal and career life."

###### Her actionable insights lead me to success

"Most people will tell you that 90%+ of trading success is mental. Those same people will spend 90% of their time developing strategies without giving much thought to the mental aspect. Is it any wonder most people are not happy with their trading performance? Kim has the right background and a lifelong passion for helping others to be better. I am one of those people. Kim helps me explore areas I need to work on and provides actionable insights. If you are committed to success, take the steps to increase your odds, hire Kim!"

###### Gets to the heart of what the challenges are

"Kim worked with me as an executive coach when I first assumed a CEO role. I found her extraordinarily helpful and supportive in that initial stage when everything is different from all you learned that got you the role.

Kim is an outstanding listener, and really gets to the heart of what the challenges are. She teaches introspection as a way to understand how to leverage your own strengths and identify what needs to change. She showed me how to see conflict as an opportunity to improve things – and how to identify where change is needed, and where it is not.

She helped give me the courage and tools to tackle thorny issues early on – and that made the rest of my time as CEO much more productive and satisfying."

###### Pulled my trader out of a dangerous slump

When one of my traders went into a long drawn out slump I reached out to Kim for help. The sessions were well worth the investment, as they paid for themself in no time. In just a few weeks she managed to help him get back to consistent profitability. His performance has continued to improve and he is back on track to being a highly successful trader. Perhaps more important were some of the intangible and unexpected benefits. Kim's advice and guidance has been impactful in some very meaningful ways. Over the next few months of coaching he transformed into a new person - his outlook and attitude have never been so positive. My only regret is not starting sooner!"

###### I now feel more on track in obtaining consistent profitability!

"Getting coached by Kim over the 6 week period was such a big help to my trading! Psychology is 80% the battle and in trading it ultimately comes down to You vs You. Kim pointed me in the right direction to gain control of myself and tame my overthinking brain which was really setting back my trading! I now feel more on track in obtaining consistent profitability!"

###### Arsenal of Mental Weapons

“I’ve never really believed in therapists or coaches of any kind. I’ve spent my whole life thinking you basically have to cure yourself of your issues. Then I met with performance coach Kim Ann Curtin. I was excited but still reluctant to dive into my personal life with a stranger. I can’t even begin to explain how much value I found in meeting with her. Kim not only made me feel like she was my best friend I could talk about anything with, but she never passed judgment and always had a tool to help me remedy my issues. Within two sessions, I had an arsenal of mental weapons to help me with both my trading issues and my life outside the markets. After meeting with Kim, I felt confident I could remedy my gremlins and grow as a person and a trader.”

###### Seeing the Potential in People

“When I reached out to Kim, I was already a very successful executive, in fact on the brink of a promotion, but I still felt my A+ game eluded me and I wanted more time for family. Kim helped me determine how to position my promotion so I could honor both. Additionally having her as a neutral sounding board enabled me to create a solution that had previously eluded me and my peers which our executive team found to be a breakthrough idea. Working with her also facilitated a more powerful interaction with my team, first by helping me to identify their needs and my own, which once met, empowered how we worked together. Kim has an eye and a heart for seeing the potential in people. I highly recommend her.”

###### My Highest Profit Month (Double My Previous Best)

“Since I started working with Kim, I’ve had my highest profit month (double my previous best). Kim brings out the best in me. We met through a mutual gig where she stood out to me thanks to her endless ideas for improving my team’s current process. I have worked with her as a coach for several months now, and I’m astounded by how she has helped me uncover the ‘dragon in the basement.’ From our first meeting, Kim has helped me improve my confidence so I can forge my own unique path. A pre-interview conversation with her helped me to nail my first interview and land a new job doing work I love. If you need help in your trading journey, career, or personal life, Kim will go above and beyond for you. Coaching is a two-way street, and much will be asked of you, but if you take it on, you’ll see changes in your trading, and your life after the first session."

###### My Work with Kim Helped to Uncover Blindspots

“As someone relatively new to trading, I sought Kim out for support. For ten years I’ve been a professional poker player, so I understand that trading is a lot like gambling and since I am someone always looking to explore areas where an edge can be found, I’ve done extensive psychological and spiritual work on myself. Kim not only boosted my confidence to continue the path I am on, but my work with her helped to uncover some blind spots. Her gentle guidance has been invaluable to me for my journey to discover my true self. Today, the calmness and serenity I bring to trading — most mornings — is largely due to this genuine, empathic, and intelligent woman.”

###### Identified Many of My Limiting Beliefs

“I was fortunate to have my company hire Kim as my coach and after working together for six months I couldn’t be happier. Kim was very observant and identified many of my limiting beliefs that I never would have seen on my own. Her guidance extended well past our one-one-one sessions. Her introductions to other resources including techniques to use in my professional and personal life as well as important books continue to serve me. The work I’ve done with Kim will stay with me for the rest of my life.”

In a nut shell, not only has my business grown, but with her guidance, I have restructured this growth business to support my life — and not the other way around. My personal life and professional life are no longer compartmentalized. By further defining my values and, with Kim’s encouragement, structuring my business to support my priorities, I now have blended personal and professional fulfillment derived from profitable activities performed in my career management practice. I recommend Kim to any driven professional who wants to find inner fulfillment from their outward achievements.”

Unexpectedly I was laid off from my company and Kim offered me immediate support, guidance and connections to successfully exit a tough situation with pride and a much anticipated outlook for my future. We worked closely together over six months and I was able to attain all of my initial goals and then some. My career aspirations are clear, core strengths identified, inner confidence returned and personal spark is prevalent in all aspects of my life.”

###### Concise Breakthroughs

“Kim Ann Curtin worked with one of our most exceptionally appreciated employees whose progress within the company was impeded by her shyness. Keenly aware of how strongly influenced she was by the traditional gender roles of her cultural background, Kim was able to help her make clear and concise breakthroughs. When Kim helped her to recognize her unique cultural perspective as an advantage, confidence emerged from within. Over the course of several months of coaching, the potential we recognized emerged and her value within the company increased.”
