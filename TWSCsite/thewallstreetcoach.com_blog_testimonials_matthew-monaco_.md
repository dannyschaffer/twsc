# Blog  Matthew Monaco

“Since I started working with Kim, I’ve had my highest profit month (double my previous best). Kim brings out the best in me. We met through a mutual gig where she stood out to me thanks to her endless ideas for improving my team’s current process. I have worked with her as a coach for several months now, and I’m astounded by how she has helped me uncover the ‘dragon in the basement.’ From our first meeting, Kim has helped me improve my confidence so I can forge my own unique path. A pre-interview conversation with her helped me to nail my first interview and land a new job doing work I love. If you need help in your trading journey, career, or personal life, Kim will go above and beyond for you. Coaching is a two-way street, and much will be asked of you, but if you take it on, you’ll see changes in your trading, and your life after the first session.”
