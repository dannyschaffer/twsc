# Blog  @BellaBullBear

“Working with Kim has been an eye-opening and transformative experience. We started by reviewing my trading habits—what was working and what wasn’t. From there, Kim introduced me to the Trader Positioning Index. Initially, I was skeptical; as it took me only ten minutes to complete so I wasn’t expecting much from it. But I was blown away by how accurate and insightful the results were. It revealed a deep connection between my work and personal mindset, pinpointing the areas I needed to focus on. What came next was truly life-changing. Kim helped me uncover and address deep-rooted issues I had been carrying since my teenage years—issues I never realized were affecting my trading and overall performance. Through her guidance, I began to heal, and my confidence grew, not just in trading but in my role as a leader at work. The results speak for themselves. Since working with Kim, my trading performance increased to a 90% win rate over the last month and a half. For the first time, I feel like I’ve reached the light at the end of the tunnel and I’m excited to see what the coming months and years will bring. Thank you, Kim, for your incredible support and expertise. I couldn’t have done this without you!”
