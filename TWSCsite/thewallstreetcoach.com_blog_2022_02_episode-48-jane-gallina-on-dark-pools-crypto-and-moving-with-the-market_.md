## Jane Gallina on Dark Pools, Crypto, and Moving with the Market

Jane Gallina aka Airplane Jane joins Kim and Lucas to discuss how her trading has transformed by following dark pool prints, her insights around crypto, and how she adapts to new information in order to move with the market. As the author of ‘#FMJ Trust Transition Trade: How Successful Traders Said It, Did It and Lived It’ a book dedicated to women in trading, Jane has become a leading voice in the female trading community.

In this conversation Jane dives into how her experience as a market participant has helped her profit and avoid major drawdowns by keeping a close eye on major dollar volume moves created by dark pools entering and leaving the market. But it’s not just dark pools that Jane relies on – she also brings attention to the fact that the markets and people have patterns, and by recognizing these patterns she’s able to step in at the right time to catch big profits.

Over the past few years Jane has become extremely curious about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Jane offers her opinion about the future of country currencies transitioning completely to digital and how she spotted and analyzed a 81-trillion dollar volume creation, transferring, and burning of $USDC on the blockchain using etherscan. Armed with this information, Jane believes that it is just a matter of time before all world currencies shift to blockchain.

Above all, Jane’s curiosity and open-mind drives her to keep searching for new ways to learn and profit from the markets. Jane’s constant desire to get a peek behind the curtain is what has led to much of her success and her passion for understanding dark pools, cryptocurrencies, and why the market moves.
