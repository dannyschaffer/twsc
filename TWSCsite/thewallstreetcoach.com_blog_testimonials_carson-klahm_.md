# Blog  Carson Klahm

“Kim is not only an incredible coach but an amazing person. I met Kim initially through her free live coaching sessions which turned into doing the trader assessment and 2 coaching sessions. The trader assessment is a MUST do for anyone who is curious about what is really going on “under the hood”. And if you are trading as a professional, it is a MUST do. I cannot thank Kim enough for the 100% attention that she gives on live coaching sessions and in-person coaching.”
