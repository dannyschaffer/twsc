# Blog  Vice President

“I reached out to Kim to fulfill a personal need of defining and re-assessing my 15 year financial career in hopes of finding career fulfillment and a greater sense of bringing my true self to the job every day. Unexpectedly I was laid off from my company and Kim offered me immediate support, guidance and connections to successfully exit a tough situation with pride and a much anticipated outlook for my future. We worked closely together over six months and I was able to attain all of my initial goals and then some. My career aspirations are clear, core strengths identified, inner confidence returned and personal spark is prevalent in all aspects of my life.”
