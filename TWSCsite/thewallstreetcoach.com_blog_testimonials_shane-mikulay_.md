# Blog  Shane Mikulay

“Kim’s small group coaching was such a great experience. I was having some mental roadblocks and through Kim’s exercises it truly helped me untangle barriers I was having. Kim has so many tools in her toolbox to help address so many different topics you might be experiencing or need help working on. I have noticed a huge difference in my trading, as well as my personal and career life.”
