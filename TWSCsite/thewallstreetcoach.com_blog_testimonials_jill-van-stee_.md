# Blog  Jill Van Stee

“All I can say is BRILLIANT! The one word I would use to describe my experience with The Wall Street Coach, Kim Ann Curtin.

Kim had the insight, focus and expertise to clearly see any and all roadblocks and speed bumps affecting my trading world and my life. Kim was able to flip them around and turn them into strengths. She was able to help me resolve other issues by providing me with a new perspective and an increase in my self-awareness.

Kim, you are a gem and have forever changed how I look at the markets and my life! You have given me an incredible tool belt full of precise strategies that can only push me in the right direction of success in this journey of life.

Thank you so much – I am forever grateful to you.”
