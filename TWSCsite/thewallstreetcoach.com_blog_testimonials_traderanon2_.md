# Blog  Trader

“Trading setups, rules and processes are absolutely critical to success. However, these are useless if one has hidden self-limiting beliefs or self-sabotaging traits. Kim pointed out a path for me to question why I am the way that I am. Just going through that reflective process has made a big difference. I am MUCH more patient and comfortable waiting for those A+ setups-and walking away if they do not present. It’s been the antidote to over trading. Thanks to Kim’s guidance, personal growth is now a significant, deliberate portion of my trading process. It’s about more than money-it’s about using trading as a tool to learn broader lessons that have an impact on myself, my family, and potentially anyone I come in contact with. In my view, trading is a fantastic, objective gauge to show evidence that I am making improvements.”
