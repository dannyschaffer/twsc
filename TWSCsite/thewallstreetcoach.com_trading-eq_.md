There’s _one_ thing that separates top traders from everyone else.

And it has NOTHING to do with market knowledge or technical analysis.

Sure, you need to understand the fundamentals first. But after that, how do the top traders keep winning and reach that next level?

- They don’t let small losses spiral into a full-blown slump.
- They don’t chase trades that aren’t in play.
- They don’t add to losers when trades start going the wrong way.

**In other words, top traders master the mental side of trading.**

They stick to their plan no matter if the markets are frothy, choppy, or otherwise.

When you master how you respond to the markets… you can say goodbye to inconsistent trading, mediocre results, and repeating mistakes.

## **The key is to increase your Trader Emotional Intelligence and make sure your EQ is as high as your IQ and…**

## **…Kim Ann Curtin’s Trading EQ Course is the best next step.**

#### _This course was able to take me out of the craziness of trading_

_“Trading EQ was able to take me out of the craziness of trading, assess myself & my trading from a deeper perspective and provided all of the tools needed to refine the biggest edge I have.. Me! Investing is 80% emotional control, 20% skill. Kim teaches you step by step how to maximise your 80% to become the most well equipped trader in the market! HIGHLY Recommend!”_

_Trading EQ_ is not “just another course on trading”. This is a proven mindset training series that focuses on the missing link to mastering the markets:

Trader Emotional Intelligence: The ability to see the market neutrally, to recognize traps in your psyche, and to become completely unfazed by the volatility of trading.

This 4 part training series will show you the roadmap for the 4 critical EQ stages.

1. _**Why Winning Traders Win and Why Losing Traders Lose:**_ Discover the fundamental elements of a **winning trader’s mindset** and how one key practice can help propel your trading career to new heights.
2. _**How to Increase Mental Toughness and Resilience:**_ Bounce back from small losses immediately to secure more winners and find more happiness trading with these practical tools.
3. _**How You are Hardwired to Hinder Your Trading:**_ Your brain is designed to help you survive, not become a successful trader. Fear, self-sabotage, and greed can become your most profitable indicators if you leverage them to your advantage.
4. _**Universal Needs & Your Inner Critic:**_ This essential training uncovers why overtrading and revenge trading are constant threats for most traders (and how to sidestep them entirely).

_\\*\\* DISCLAIMER: This course is \*only\* for traders who are willing to think differently. If you’re convinced the only way to become a more successful trader is to learn more chart patterns or technical indicators, please do not buy this course._
