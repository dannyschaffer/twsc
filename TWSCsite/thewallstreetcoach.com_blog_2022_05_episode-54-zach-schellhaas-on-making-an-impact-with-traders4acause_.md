# Zach Schellhaas on Making an Impact with Traders4ACause

Zach Schellhaas joins the Wall Street Coach Podcast to discuss how traders can find community, be a contribution, and make an impact with Traders4ACause.

With his dynamic background, ranging from marketing and advertising to trading and account management, Zach has flourished in his role as Executive Director at Traders4ACause.

In this episode Zach dives into what makes Traders4ACause so unique, including creating a community for traders that often work in isolation and encourages these same traders to be a contribution to society. As Zach describes, some of the most profound benefits he has seen in traders is their shift from a “scarcity mindset” to a “mindset of abundance.” As Zach points out, this mindset shift is invaluable for traders and making the shift is often what allows traders to take the next step and become more successful than they could have imagined.

Traders4ACause supports numerous charities, including charities on the local, national, and international level. If you’re a trader looking to give back, consider making an impact with Traders4ACause.
