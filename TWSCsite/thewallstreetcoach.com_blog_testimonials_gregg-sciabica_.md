# Blog  Gregg Sciabica

When one of my traders went into a long drawn out slump I reached out to Kim for help. The sessions were well worth the investment, as they paid for themself in no time. In just a few weeks she managed to help him get back to consistent profitability. His performance has continued to improve and he is back on track to being a highly successful trader. Perhaps more important were some of the intangible and unexpected benefits. Kim’s advice and guidance has been impactful in some very meaningful ways. Over the next few months of coaching he transformed into a new person – his outlook and attitude have never been so positive. My only regret is not starting sooner!”
