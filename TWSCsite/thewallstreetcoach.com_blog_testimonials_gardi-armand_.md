# Blog  Gardi Armand

“Working with Kim was like holding up a mirror I didn’t know I needed. After taking the Trader Positioning Index, Kim was able to get to the root of patterns that had been holding me back — not just professionally, but personally. I honestly didn’t think the assessment would reveal much at first, but once we reviewed the results, I was in a total WOW state.

I came in thinking I needed help with a specific challenge, and walked away with a completely new perspective on myself and my potential. Kim really drills down to the root cause, which is so important. My trading has improved, and I feel like a HUGE weight has been lifted off my back — it’s the best feeling ever.

My overall quality of life has also improved, as Kim gave me actionable steps to get back on track not just in trading, but in my personal life as well. The clarity I’ve gained has changed how I show up in my business, how I communicate, and how I lead.

Working with her was one of the most valuable decisions I’ve made. Kim is a must-do — there’s no other way to describe my experience with her.”
