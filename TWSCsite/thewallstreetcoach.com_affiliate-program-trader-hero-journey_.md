**COMMISSION DETAILS**

Affiliate earns a commission if their unique referral link is the LAST CLICK from a customer that leads to a purchase. Affiliate earns a commission at a rate of 20% when someone makes a purchase using Affiliate’s unique referral link. Commission amounts are the cost of the total cart value less any discounts, refunds, chargebacks and payment processing fees.

For example, if a customer checks out for $1000, Affiliate’s commission will be $194 at most on a 20% commission due to a 3% payment processing fee.

Affiliate payouts are made at least once every month. Affiliate sales will qualify for payout after 30 days after customer’s purchase with Affiliate’s link. All payouts are delivered via the payment method You set up in Tipalti. There is a $25 minimum payout threshold before a payout will be made, regardless of when the sales in the payout were earned by Affiliate.

If a customer asks for a refund after making a purchase through an affiliate link, the affiliate commission for that sale will be revoked. This means that the affiliate will not receive a commission for that particular sale. If the affiliate has already been paid for the sale, then the refunded amount will be deducted from their balance. If the commission hasn’t been approved yet, then it will not be approved and the affiliate will not receive any payment for that sale.
