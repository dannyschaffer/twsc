# Blog  VED

“Not only has my trading turned around, but my life has too. I’ve been struggling with trading for 2 years and on top of that went through a divorce. My home and work life was in shambles and my stress level had never been so high. I decided to get help in my hope to find relief. Once I started working with Kim, my trading took a 180-degree turn and my win rate rocketed to 75%. I even went on a winning streak of 16 days in a row. My self-confidence has improved and my stress levels have decreased significantly. Thank you, Kim!”
