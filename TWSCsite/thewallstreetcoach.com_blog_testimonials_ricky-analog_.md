# Blog  Ricky Analog

“Never in a million years could I have expected this assessment to return the kinds of results and insights that it yielded. I am floored at the accuracy of it as well as the guidance it points towards. If you have not taken the Positioning Index, you seriously can’t know the areas you need to work on to improve not just in your trading, but in your life.”
