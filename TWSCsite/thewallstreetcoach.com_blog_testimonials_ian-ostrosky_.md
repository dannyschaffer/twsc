# Blog  Ian Ostrosky

“I’ve taken a handful of personality tests in my life, and nothing compares to the EPI. The usefulness of any tool is contingent on the skill of the individual wielding it. The assessment by itself was highly informative, but the greatest impact came from Kim’s ability to break down the results in the context of my roadblocks and objectives. Her analysis and insight is unparalleled and I was beyond impressed. Our consultation has been the catalyst for a much-needed transformation in my relationship to myself, my work, and my goals. I could not be more grateful that our paths crossed.”
