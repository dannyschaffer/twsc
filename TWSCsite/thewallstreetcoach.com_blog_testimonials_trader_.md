# Blog  Trader

“I didn’t fully understand the value of having optimized hormones until I saw my portfolio returns jump from 5% to 30%. The delicate balance of hormones in the body has a massive impact on my ability to make calm, rational decisions in response to fluctuations in the market. What started with a comprehensive blood test has led to better performance in trading, in the gym, and the bedroom. Kim is one of the rare coaches out there that understands the importance of hormone health when it comes to trading effectively and sustainably.”
