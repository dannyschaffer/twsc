Have you ever noticed there's one piece
of marketing advice that everyone keeps
repeating? Storytelling. Storytelling is
a powerful tool to leverage storytelling
to sell more. Sounds brilliant until you
actually try to use it on your landing
page. Suddenly, you're wondering, tell a
story about what? My company history, a
customer case study. The confusion is
real and it's costing you conversions.
But after helping hundreds of service
businesses fix this exact problem, I've
cracked the code on what storytelling
actually means in this context, and it's
probably not what you think. When you do
it right, storytelling can improve your
landing page conversion rate by up to
300%. But when done wrong, it can
actually push potential clients away. In
The science behind storytelling
this video, I'm going to show you the
science behind why storytelling sells
three times better than traditional
marketing approaches. the three proven
storytelling frameworks that work
specifically for service business
landing pages and exactly how to
implement them with real examples so you
can transform your website from
confusing to converting overnight. But
before we get there, we need to
understand why stories work better than
traditional marketing on landing pages.
So to really make this come alive, I
want to show you two ways that I could
tell you about my web design service.
The traditional way
First, the traditional way. We offer
professional web design with responsive
layouts, SEO optimization, and
conversion focused elements. Our team
has 10 years of experience, and we've
served over 200 clients. Now, the
The storytelling way
storytelling way. You've spent thousands
on a website that looks great, but it's
gotten you exactly zero leads so far.
Each morning, you check your inbox
hoping for inquiries, only to find spam
and newsletters. Meanwhile, competitors
with uglier websites somehow attract
clients effortlessly. Which approach
made you feel something? The science
shows that when information makes us
feel, our brains release chemicals like
dopamine and oxytocin. The same
chemicals released during important life
experiences. This chemical cocktail
doesn't just make us pay attention. It
literally helps us remember and trust
the message more. This is why
storytelling in your landing page isn't
just creative fluff. It's a neurological
What makes stories so powerful
strategy for connection. I sat down with
Talia Wolf, the CEO at Get Uplift, a
conversion optimization agency that
specializes in storytelling, to get her
take on what makes stories so powerful.
Turns out even she didn't get it right
away. When we first got started with
conversion optimization, what we were
trying to do is basically change
elements on the page. So, we try
changing a call to action button or a
headline or reducing a form field
because those were the best practices.
That's what everyone was telling you to
do. If you want to increase conversions,
do this one thing, you know, here's one
hack. But it never worked. And even when
it did, it didn't really generate the
results that we needed for our clients.
What I uncovered, which is, you know, a
lot of psychologists and neuroscientists
have proven, you know, years and years
and years now, is that every decision
that we make in life is based on
emotion. There's always emotion
involved. In fact, without emotion, we
can't make any decision. And what kind
of emotions are we really talking about
here? There are two very common emotions
that keep repeating themselves in
purchasing decisions. One is self-image
and the other is social image.
Self-image is how people want to feel
about themselves after using your
solution. And social image is the
emotional trigger of how people want
others to perceive them after using your
solution. And telling the right kind of
story on your page can really play into
those. But let's clear up the confusion
by first talking about what storytelling
on landing pages is not. It's not
telling a third person narrative like
meet Sally who struggled with
bookkeeping until she found our service.
If you were to do that, it would
probably just come across as cheesy and
possibly even childish. It is also not
your company origin story. Most visitors
don't really care about how you started
your business or your journey to
success. Harsh, but true. It's not a
creative writing exercise that belongs
in a novel. And most importantly, it's
not talking about yourself the whole
time. So, this is the biggest mistake
that I see service businesses make on
their landing pages. Basically, turning
them into
autobiographies instead of focusing on
the customer. What keeps us on a page
and what grabs our attention is when we
make our story about them. If you are
going to be generic and you're going to
talk about the service that you provide,
your pricing, the features, and you talk
about yourself, that is not going to
grab anyone's attention. So, what is
effective storytelling on a landing
page? Turns out it's surprisingly
simple. Storytelling is the art of
making it about the customer. It's
essentially saying that I know you, my
prospect. I understand what you're going
through and here's what I can see that
you're going through and actually
proving it and saying I know you feel
this. I know you've tried that. Here's
why it's never worked for you and here's
what will work for you. The key is that
it's almost always done using the second
person, you know, you to really put them
in the story. It's about transformation.
Zoom in on specific moments
You know, showing the path from where
they are to where they want to be. But
here's the thing. It's not enough to
just tell people about the
transformation. You need to zoom in on
specific moments that make it feel real.
Like let's say you're a personal trainer
writing your landing page. You know, you
could just say something like, "I get
it. You're trying to get fit, but it's
hard to do on your own. Hire me
instead." Or you could say, you know how
every single year you set new goals for
the next year and you start out in
January and you're really excited about
them and you get going and you're
reading those books or you're going to
the gym and come February you go a
little less and come March you're
already like not going and in April
you've forgotten and you're still paying
for that membership. That's the
difference between just saying you need
to go to the gym or here's how to set
goals versus actually telling a story
where you're portraying their life
story. You're showing them them on a
page. The truth is there are many
different ways you can use storytelling
in your landing pages, but there happen
to be three that I found to work better
than the others that really play into
those emotions that drive sales
decisions. So I'll let Talia tell you
about the first you can use PAS like
Pain Agitation Solution
pain agitation solution like the you
know number one uh template everyone
uses it it's so basic but so good
because you start with the pain you
start by talking about here's what
you're going through right here's the
pain that you're experiencing a great
example of this is on Zenfounders
website so they have these three
distinct sections starting with the
problem that entrepreneurs face it does
this by just asking a simple question
that their clients would likely say yes
to. Have you lost touch with what's most
important, but it's not enough just to
name the pain. You then need to agitate
it. That's the A in P A S. Talking about
how it affects their lives, why they
need to change it. This next section
does exactly that by listing out all the
little symptoms of that main problem
like feeling tired, foggy about who you
are, carrying around resentment. It's
agitating the pain. Yes, but you do this
to show that you get them and what
they're going through, not just to make
them feel worse or to be a fear-monger.
Then the very next section provides the
S in our equation. This is where Dr.
Sherry reveals herself and her unique
qualification as the world's only
clinical psychologist focused on the
mental health of entrepreneurs as the
solution to the problem. This is such a
simple three-part formula, but it's
incredibly effective. The second
Before to After Bridge
framework is the before to after bridge.
So, this shows the contrast between life
before and after your solution. Now, to
do this, you just paint a picture of
their current situation, then introduce
you and your business or offer as the
bridge that gets them to their happily
ever after. A really great example of
this approach is on teamwork.com. It's a
project management platform. In this one
tight section, they state the before,
the bridge, then the after. So, this
framework works great because it
directly addresses what people want,
transformation. And the person
responsible for this website is actually
Talia herself. So when you redid
Teamwork's website and you implemented
the story structure throughout it, what
kind of results did that get? We
increased their signups by 54%. We 7
times their homepage conversion rates
and we also got 170% increase in signups
on some of their landing pages. It was
really interesting to see just because
ultimately it was mostly messaging. So
The Heros Journey
that brings us to our third storytelling
method, my personal favorite, the hero's
journey. This is a more long- form story
framing device you'd use on your whole
page with each section representing a
different stage in the journey. Now,
this framework highlights your customer
as the hero. It shows their current
struggle, how they set out to solve it,
and the transformation that happens when
they work with you. It's a proven way to
make your service feel like a really
guided path from failure to success. If
you've heard of story brand, this is
really the inspiration behind that. So
this landing page for newborn care
service petite crew is a perfect example
of the hero's journey framework in
action. So let's go through each stage
of the hero's journey and see how it's
put into practice on a real business's
website. Starting with step one, set the
stage. Now this is where you lay out the
foundation of your customers current
world. What's their everyday situation
look like right now before they find
your service? Petite Crews website
starts with welcoming a new baby is all
the things magical, awe inspiring,
exhausting. They paint the picture of
sleepdeprived parents who really want to
enjoy their newborn but are too tired to
be fully in the moment. Then comes stage
two, call to adventure. This is where
you want to introduce the challenge or
pain point that's pushing them to look
for help. Petite Cru simply says it's
hard to bond when you're sleepd
deprived. that highlights the core
problem that needs solving here. Stage
three, meeting the mentor. So, this is
where your service steps in and you
position your business as the expert
guide or mentor figure who helps them
get what they want. Petite Crew has this
covered in a whole standalone section
where they talk about how they not only
get what you're going through, but they
have the experience to get you through
it. They also explain their really
rigorous screening that eliminates 96%
of applicants. They position themselves
as the connectors to expert help. Next,
we have stage four, overcoming
obstacles, aka the journey. So, this is
where you want to lay out exactly what
working with you will look like. Now,
petite crew shows a clear three-step
process. Consultation, meeting
candidates, and hiring the perfect
match. And then finally, we have stage
five, return with the elixir, aka the
transformation. So, this is just where
you show the positive outcome of working
with you. And they end with, "Newborns
are amazing. You ought to be able to
cherish the season without missing a
beat." And they've done something really
smart here, which is use customer
stories and testimonials to do some of
that heavy lifting for them. Businesses
forget that actually social proof is one
of the most important tools you can have
and the biggest selling points you can
have and it's very big with storytelling
because it's so much more powerful when
someone else is saying it than yourself.
So actually having someone say you know
before I contacted this person I was
really worried this was going to be a
7-month process and it would take me
ages to see results. I couldn't believe
it. Within 3 days, I already felt better
seeing the results on myself and my
confidence. That's a big big difference
between you saying it and them saying
it. But if you want to actually create a
landing page that gets results, you're
going to need a start to finish plan.
So, in this video, I've got the seven
steps you need to take to create a
million-doll landing page that's proven
to convert at three times the average.
So, click right here and I'm going to
show you all seven steps so you can do
it right. the first time. Meet you right
over here in a

If you want your website to actually
convert visitors into clients, I'm going
to show you the perfect homepage
structure that works every time for
every business out there. Because here's
the truth. It's not about your traffic
or how good it looks or even your
services. Now, I've analyzed thousands
and built hundreds of service business
websites, and it turns out the real
problem is that your homepage is
probably organized like a brochure
rather than like a real sales
conversation. But here's what changes
everything. There is a specific
10section psychological sequence that
walks visitors through an emotional
journey from stranger to buyer in about
90 seconds of scrolling. And today I'm
breaking down the exact anatomy section
by section. All right, so let's dive
right in starting at the very top with
what we call the hero section. You know,
people will also call this above the
fold. It's up to you. But here's the
thing. Once people land here, you've got
about 5 seconds to convince them to stay
or they're going to leave. 5 seconds.
And I want you to guess the biggest
reason for people abandoning a website.
Co-arketing did a study where they asked
real website visitors what annoyed them
the most causing them to leave. And it
turns out the biggest reason wasn't
pop-ups or even slow loading pages. It
was a lack of message. In other words,
the websites that didn't make it crystal
clear what they can do for you and how
they make your life better just confuse
people enough that they leave. And that
means they'll never see the rest of your
homepage, no matter how nice it looks or
how much time you spent on it. And
you'll notice there's a few things going
on here. And they each serve a purpose.
So, let's start with this right here,
what we call eyebrow copy. It just sits
on top of the headline. And it's there
to call out your ideal clients. Are they
overworked teachers, busy car owners,
unemployed job seekers in Houston?
Whoever your perfect client avatar is,
name them here so they know this is for
them. And that brings us to the
headline. And this is where 95% of
businesses completely blow it. Your
headline needs to promise your client's
desire or the problem that you'll solve
for them, not just describe what you do.
This here is the emotional buyin. And
emotion always comes first in buying
decisions. And that's not just according
to me. That's according to Harvard
professor Gerald Zaltman who researched
consumer behavior extensively. So to
just focus on the what we do part and
not on the what you get part is like
throwing 95% of your profits right out
the window. So your headline could say
something like, you know, get your dream
kitchen without the nightmare renovation
instead of just kitchen remodeling
services. Nobody wakes up wanting
kitchen remodeling services, right? They
wake up wanting that beautiful kitchen
without the hassle. Now, directly below
the headline, we have the sub headline.
So, this is where you finally explain
how you deliver on that promise. So,
this could say something like, you know,
Tampa Bay's stress-free kitchen
remodeling team from design to
installation in just 3 weeks. Now, they
know what you actually do. Plus, you've
called out your location. And if you're
a local business, that's really
important, not just for local SEO, but
also just so people on your page know
that you can work with them. And next,
we have your call to action button. So,
this needs to be really specific about
what actually happens next. Don't try to
get cute or clever with it. And don't
just say something like contact us or
learn more. Those are conversion killers
because people are just always a little
unsure about what that's going to mean.
Are they just going to be filling out a
form and then waiting for you to call
them back or what? So, it should say
something like, "Book your free design
consultation." Right? It tells them
exactly what happens next. Now, here's
something interesting that most big
businesses that have in actually
invested in website optimization do that
most small businesses skip, and that is
add some kind of social proof right here
in the hero section before you ever have
to scroll down at all. You could have a
few customer photos like this with text
like, you know, join 500 happy
homeowners. Or you could just put one
killer testimonial snippet if you wanted
to highlight your best one. And I do
like to add this fivestar graphic just
so that it immediately reads as a
fivestar review, even if they were to,
you know, skip actually reading the
words. And that's important because most
people do skim websites. They don't read
every word. So, we need to lean into
that with these little visual indicators
when we can. And the image over here,
this is really important to again help
you tell the story more visually. And
most businesses really mess this up by
either showing people meant to be the
workers in the business doing the actual
work or some, you know, woo woo photo of
a person doing this on a cliff. And
nobody in the history of the world has
ever actually done this outside of a
stock photo shoot, by the way. Or
they'll do a skyline or an object of
some kind, but what you want to show
here is the happy result. So, if you're
a landscaper, don't show yourself mowing
a lawn. Show the family enjoying their
beautiful backyard afterwards. If you're
a financial adviser, show someone
relaxing because their retirement is
finally secure. always the after state,
never during the messy middle, always
the customer, never you or the people
who work for the business. Now, the
reason that everything in the hero
section is about the client and how
their life can be better is because they
have to come here and see their story
reflected on the page or they just won't
care. Okay, so moving on, right under
the the true hero section, you want to
add these three little check marks. Now,
these are meant to be three quick
outcomes or results, super short, like,
you know, three to four words each.
These could be things like beautiful new
kitchen, higher home value, zero
renovation stress, boom, boom, boom. So,
these are the actual results they'll get
from working with you. Now, this video
really isn't so much about design or
even layout. It's much more just about
the actual content that your perfect
homepage should include, but I know that
you probably want to see what this would
look like on mobile, too. So, I am going
to show you each section as we go on
both. So, just see how everything stacks
vertically. The key difference here is
making sure that that call to action
button stays above the fold. Meaning,
it's going to be visible without them
having to scroll cuz mobile visitors are
even more impatient than desktop users.
So, if they have to scroll to find out
what to do next, you may have lost them.
Okay, so next up we have the section
that just bluntly brings up the main
problem that your ideal client is
currently feeling. Now, to do this
right, you do need to actually know the
problem that you solve. And for some
businesses, this is a complete
no-brainer. But for others, it can be
really easy to fixate on the wrong
problem. So, it's usually worth doing
some really thorough client research.
And it's pretty easy. I actually just
use chat GBT with the deep research
feature to help me figure that out. But
once you know the problem, you need to
go a little further and agitate it by
bringing up some of the symptoms of the
problem. You know, I've got that here as
bullet points, which can work really
well. You can also do it as just a few
short paragraphs, whatever feels best
for you. Now, I do get push back on this
from some business owners who say,
"Well, you know, I don't want to go
negative or be a fear-monger, but this
really isn't about that at all. What
you're doing when you bring up the
problem that they're already having, by
the way, it shows that you understand it
and it implies that you have the answer
for it." And this one's really easy to
translate to mobile. Again, it just
stacks like this. And speaking of having
the answer to their problem, this next
section leans into that where you
introduce the solution, which is you and
your service. So, you want to lead into
this section with some kind of a
statement about how you get it. You
understand their pain because you've
either been through it yourself or
you've seen how it can affect the lives
of countless people before them. Then
once you've established that you
understand them, then you can go into
the section about why you're qualified
to help them through it. So this one
quick section establishes you as the
mentor figure that they need to get what
they ultimately want. And this is the
perfect section to add a photo of
yourself to just to build that
face-to-face trust. because I've seen
way too many service business websites
that just look like they're full of
stock photos or AI photos with no trace
of real humans behind the business. And
today, when trust is at an all-time low,
you need to show them that you're real
and you stand behind your work publicly.
And I would try to actually get a decent
photo here, not some dark green snapshot
from 15 years ago. You know, smartphones
take great photos. So, just make sure
it's well lit and that you look friendly
and trustworthy. And for mobile, again,
it's just stacked. And I I would just
make the photo a bit shorter heightwise
so that people don't need to scroll as
much. Okay, moving on. Next, we have the
benefit section. Um, where you want to
call out three main benefits that your
customers can expect from you. So, this
is super important because here is where
you're going to try to set yourself
apart from your competitors by either
bringing up extras or perks that you
bring that your competition doesn't or
you know, maybe there are things that
your competition does too. But if you're
the one talking about it and they're
not, the end results the same. You win.
And benefits tend to really trip people
up because they always confuse them with
features. And the best way I can think
of to show you the difference between
benefits and features is on HelloFresh's
website right here. Check out what
they're leading with in these headlines.
More choices, less boredom. Uh they
could have made this headline about the
20 new weekly recipes, but that's really
just the feature that brings the real
benefit, which is you won't ever get
bored of the same meals over and over
again. Then we have quicker recipes,
less prep work, which is all about
saving time, but said very specifically
as it applies to this. Then healthier
meals just as tasty. So rather than just
labeling this as dietitionian approved
meals, it's all about how you'll be
healthier and you'll love the taste. So
list out your three most compelling
benefits and then go into the feature
that makes the benefit possible. And you
also do want a visual um that helps
illustrate each benefit, too. So, you
can use photos here or icons, whatever
works best for you. Okay. Next, we have
testimonials. So, it is incredibly
important to include social proof like
this on your homepage so people can see
proof that what you're claiming is
actually true. And that matters because
72% of people will only take that next
step with you after reading a positive
review. So, I like to include three
here. So try to find three testimonials
that actually do a good job saying
something that's going to help someone,
you know, either overcome an objection
or talk about a pain point or one that
talks about the outcome or the result
that the rest of your page is promising.
So what we don't want here are those
bland, you know, great service, highly
recommended testimonials that don't
really say anything. Every testimonial
on your homepage needs to say something
specific to earn their place here. And
please keep them short. Like this amount
of text I have here is pretty much what
you want to shoot for if you can. Then
include their photo if you can get their
permission to use it. It just helps it
hit harder because you know, hey, if
this person's willing to publicly stand
behind this review, I can trust it,
right? And again, you want to use a
fivestar graphic here is just visual
shortorthhand for people to see that
this is in fact a glowing five-star
review. And to pile on to the social
proof, if you happen to have a bunch of
great reviews on review sites like, you
know, Google or Yelp, whatever that is,
you can always drop a line like this
right down here using those review site
logos just to show people that they're
safe choosing you because lots of other
people have gone before and they all had
a great experience. So now people know
how you can help them and they've even
seen proof that it works. But some
people still may not be sure how this
all works. And that uncertainty can kill
a sale. That's where the simple
three-step section comes in to show them
how easy it's going to be on them to not
only get started, but to get to the
finish line. And this is psychological
gold. People are terrified of
complexity. And if working with you
seems complicated at all, they'll find
someone else even if you're better. And
yes, you want exactly three steps here.
Not four, not five, three. And here's
the formula that always works. So step
one should always be them taking action.
Book your free consultation. Call us
today. It's whatever your call to action
button says. You'd pretty much just
repeat that right here. Step two is your
process simplified down to its essence,
right? We design your perfect space or
we handle everything. It's basically
where all of your actual process
happens, but you're taking it out of
their hands and letting them know how
you're taking care of all those messy
middle parts. And step three is always
their happy outcome. So, enjoy your
beautiful new kitchen or whatever the
result is. You're literally showing
them, do this simple thing. We'll handle
the middle part. You get the result you
want. That simple. Now, you can use
images here like I have or this can just
be text. But the important part is that
you're actually labeling these as step
one, step two, step three. Because I've
seen people mess this up with just one,
two, three, um, which is a lot less
clear and they may just skim over them
and think that, you know, these are just
more features or services or something.
You could even use arrows or a visual
timeline connecting these steps
together. Make it feel like a journey,
not a list. Now, on mobile, the big
change here is just going from a
horizontal layout to a vertical
timeline. Trying to show a horizontal
process on a phone screen never works.
You know, people can't see the full
flow. So, vertical is going to be the
only way to go here. Okay, moving on to
our next section. This is where you're
really going to separate yourself from
your competition. I call it the flex
section for two reasons. Because this is
where you get to flex your unique
advantages, and it's also pretty
flexible in how you present it. So,
you've got two options here. Option A is
what I call the 10 reasons why list. And
here's how you can do this yourself. So,
first you want to research the top
decision criteria that people use when
they're choosing a business like yours.
And again, I would just go to Chat GBT
and use either deep research or agent
mode. Tell it to scour review sites and
forum sites like Reddit and Kora. Then
you just want to basically reverse
engineer those decision-making factors
into a checklist of what makes you
different. literally the reasons why to
choose you over any other business. Now,
this works great when you can't directly
claim superiority. You know, maybe
you're not the cheapest, but you can
still list what you do well. Option B
here is the comparison chart. So, us
versus the other guys. But only use this
if you can honestly show advantages
here. You know, each row needs to
actually compare apples to apples. So,
make sure that each row is talking about
the same topic, not just two random
unrelated lists of the things that make
you good and the things that make them
bad. And again, with the visual
indicators, you want to visually show
that your list is good and theirs is bad
with little icons like this.
Traditionally, green means good. So,
don't get too caught up in using your
brand colors here. I would stick with
the classics because people know what it
means. Green is good and red or even,
you know, grayed out like this means bad
or at least worse. And the icon choice
here matters, too. Check marks literally
mean check. We've got that. And the X
means they don't, obviously. So, don't
just choose random icons. These tend to
work the best. Now, on mobile, the
comparison chart can get a little
tricky. You'll need to get creative to
make it work. The 10 reasons list
translates a lot easier. It just becomes
a narrower checklist. Okay. Next, we've
talked about benefits and features, and
this is where those plain old features
are going to go. Um, think of this like
the tech specs for a TV that you're
going to buy online. So, you may be
saying, "But I thought benefits were the
important thing, not features." And yes,
benefits are more important than
features in general, but remember that
Harvard professor earlier who found that
almost all buying decisions are made
with emotion first. Well, that's only
part of the story because for some
people, they then need to back that
emotional decision up with logic before
they're going to buy. So, this is the
part where we let those extra analytical
people justify that emotional buyin by
seeing exactly what they're going to
get. So, here's where you'd put things
like, you know, free design
consultation, 3D renderings, all permits
handled, daily cleanup, and 10-year
workmanship warranties. So, I usually
like to put anywhere from 10 to 20
features here, either in a simple bullet
list or like this with icons for each
one. Okay. Next, we have frequently
asked questions. Now, yes, this is used
to proactively answer common questions
that people ask you all the time, which
is just going to help qualify people in
a little easier. But more importantly,
this is a place to proactively handle
objections that they may have, too. So,
think of this section as almost like a
virtual salesperson on your homepage
making the case for your business as
airtight as possible. So, what are those
five or six questions that people need
answered or objections that they're
going to need settled before they feel
comfortable taking the next step? Just
write each out as a question. Then
address each one with your answer or if
it's an objection, what's your best
rebuttal against that objection? Okay.
Okay. And next we have a really simple
call to action section where you just
ask them if they're ready to get started
or you know some version of that. Try to
make it specific to their dream outcome.
And then you're just going to repeat the
same call to action button as you had in
the hero section. But guess what? That's
just the homepage. There's definitely
more to a website that converts visitors
into paying clients. So I want to invite
you to my free ondemand master class.
how to build a client generating website
that sells your services for you. Just
click right here and you can get
immediate access to my most in-depth
video training yet, where I'm going to
show you what you need on your website,
what to take off right now that's
hurting your ability to get leads, and
how to seamlessly bring it all to life
in just one weekend. So, click here.


Each of these landing pages are
converting visitors to leads at 15% or
higher, and they're 100% yours to steal
for yourself. But before you just start
copying, you need to understand why
these pages work overtime for their
businesses, while most just crash and
burn. After building and testing over
300 landing pages for just about every
type of service business you can
imagine, I can tell you it's not because
they're ugly. It's not because they're
missing some fancy feature. and it's
definitely not because they're using the
wrong software. The real difference
comes down to understanding exactly what
makes people take action. In this video,
I'm going to show you three proven
landing page templates that you can copy
section by section to dramatically boost
your conversions. the exact
psychological principles that make
people say yes to your offer instead of
clicking away and the biggest mistakes
that are secretly killing your landing
page conversions right now, including
one that 90% of businesses make without
even realizing it. When you get this
right, you can take a landing page from
converting 2 to 3% of visitors to 15% or
higher. That's the difference between
losing money on ads and making a serious
profit. But before we dive into these
templates, we need to talk about
something that happened in my weekly
small groupoup coaching call last week.
So, one of my students, he's a realtor
in Poland. He brought this landing page
to me that he'd been running Google ads
to. He was frustrated because he'd
gotten 200 clicks that he paid for, but
zero conversions. Not a single person
filled out his form. Now, when I looked
at his page, it actually looked really
nice and professional. Clean design,
good photos, the whole nine yards. But
that is kind of the problem. He was so
focused on making it look good that he
completely missed what actually makes
people convert. And this is the perfect
example to show you what I mean. Because
we're going to transform this
non-converting page into one that could
be worth millions to his business. Cuz
here's what most people don't get. About
90% of landing pages fail because they
start with a weak offer. Because if
you're not offering something people can
get fired up about, nothing else we do
on the page is really going to matter.
And this guy's offer just wasn't it,
right? We'll help you sell your property
without stress and paperwork. I mean, it
sounds nice, but it's just not enough to
make me want to choose this realtor over
any of the other ones out there. It's a
pretty basic promise that literally any
realtor should make. It's kind of like a
restaurant saying, you know, we'll make
you some food so you don't have to cook.
doesn't really get you excited, does it?
This should really be positioning them
as the better choice compared to other
realtor. So, what do people really want
in a realtor? You know, someone who's
going to get them the most money and get
it sold fast, right? Here's what's
really going on. So, by the time people
get to this page through a Google ad,
they already know that they need a good
realtor. That means they're what we call
solution aware. Let me explain this
because it's super important. So there
are five stages of customer awareness.
At the top, you have people who are
completely unaware. They don't even know
they have a problem yet. And at the
bottom, you have people who are most
aware. They know everything and they're
ready to buy. This realtor's clients are
right in the middle, right? They're
solution aware. They know they have to
hire a realtor. What they don't know yet
is which specific realtor they should go
with. So this landing page just needs to
move them to the next stage which is
product aare meaning they know this
realtor is the one they want to go with.
So now let's completely reimagine this
page starting with this top section. So
this is what some people call above the
fold but I just call it the hero
section. So here's the new offer that I
came up with that goes way beyond just
you know we'll sell your house without
stress. It's get a record- setting price
for your home in 30 days or we'll wave
our commission. Now, that's a real offer
that would get people interested. It's
specific, it's bold, and it puts their
money where their mouth is. Okay, so now
let's take a look at the other parts of
the hero section. So, first we have what
we call the eyebrow copy up here. Um,
that's just basically where we call out
the ideal customer. Then, of course, we
have the headline. We already went over
that. That highlights the offer. Then we
have our subheading here which goes
deeper into what they actually offer and
the benefits of it. And next we have the
call to action button. So I decided to
go for an apply call to action button
which is great for implying exclusivity.
Now that won't always work especially if
you're selling a product. But if you're
a service business, especially if what
you offer is kind of on the upper end of
the market and you want to maybe weed
some people out, this apply kind of
language can work really well for that.
Then I added this bit here, only a few
openings left to create some additional
urgency. And then beneath we have some
social proof, which lets people know
that it's safe to work with us because
we've done this for lots of other people
before and we've gotten them good
results. This right here removes a lot
of the hesitation that people might have
about actually clicking the button.
Okay, so moving down the page, what we
have next here is a section highlighting
the benefits of the offer. In this case,
we have some stats to share, which is
really powerful if you have them. These
could be results, outcomes, anything
that makes the offer stand out from your
competition. And you really want to go
beyond saying things like, you know,
great customer service or just basic
stuff like that. These should really
make the reader take notice and lean
forward. Okay, next up, I really wanted
to promote these testimonials
prominently. Since the people are coming
to this page are already solution aware,
we don't really need to waste a lot of
time with a long sales letter section
where we explain the problem. You know,
once they know the general solution,
which is to hire the right realtor, we
just want to get them to choose this
realtor specifically. And nothing works
better than real stories from real
customers. Now, I want you to notice
I've included photos of each of the
clients. This helps a lot just by
showing that there these people are
willing to stand behind their words
publicly. It's a psychological thing,
but it just makes it feel a lot more
believable than if they seemed
anonymous. Okay, next section. So,
people may not always know how the offer
actually works. So, we want to make it
easy to understand with a simple
three-step process section. So, step one
is always going to be the same as the
call to action. In this case, apply to
work with us. Step two is where all your
actual work happens. Then, step three is
the happy ending where their house is
sold, they made money, and it was all
quick and painless. So, the point here
isn't to actually show every single step
that you go through. It's to make it
look this easy for your customer, right?
While pointing them in the right
direction here to get going. Okay. Next,
moving along, I decided to put even more
social proof. So, in this case, um it's
showing recent home sales and their
prices, including little notes like, you
know, $70,000 over asking or 12 offers.
Now, this is to show proof that this
actually works. So, if you're not a
realtor, you can just show even more
testimonials or some kind of version of
this that applies to your offer with
real stats and numbers. Okay. Next up,
we have a 10 reasons why section. So, I
love this because these aren't just 10
random reasons, right? These are based
on research of the actual
decision-making criteria of your ideal
customer. And you can do this through
interviews or what I would recommend
these days, I actually just use Chad GBT
to find this kind of thing for me in
less than 10 minutes using their deep
research mode. So you just find that
decision-making criteria. Then you kind
of spin those into these 10 reasons. But
people may still have doubts about
whether this offer is truly any better
than what they can get from other
realtor. And that's why I like this
comparison section so much. So, it
directly compares what this offer is
going to give you above and beyond what
you can expect to get anywhere else. You
just want to really make sure here that
each line is comparing apples to apples,
not just two random lists of why you're
good and why why they're bad, right? So,
see how each line here is talking about
the same topic, drawing a really
specific comparison. That's what you
want. Okay. Next, we have a are we right
for you section. So, this works great
because it directly answers the only
real question they have at this point.
Is this right for me? Honestly, there
are tons of ways to do this, but I
absolutely love this treatment that I
picked up for my friend Alicia Conlin.
Shout out to her channel. This layout
just does a really good job of painting
these really clear and specific
scenarios that your page visitors might
find themselves in. Then, it points to a
testimonial that matches that exact
scenario. It's so clean and direct that
it just works amazingly well. And then
you just want to end it with a really
clear call to action section with the
same button as we had before up top. So
this page works great if your visitors
are solution aware. But what if they're
only problem aware? Remember that means
they know they have a problem. They
don't know what the solution is yet. In
that case, you just want to add another
section. We call it the sales letter
section right between the benefits bar
here and the testimonials. Now, this
sales letter section is just going to
present the problem and really drive it
home in a few paragraphs of text. Or you
can always use this next landing page
concept that's even more clever in what
it does. So, when people are problem
aware, you want to attract them with the
problem itself. So, this landing page is
basically a sales pitch for your offer.
cleverly disguised as an article. I've
seen this called an advertorial. I've
seen it called a pre-sell article. But
whatever you call it, this specific type
of landing page can boost your
conversion rates by up to 79%. Data for
more than 41,000 landing pages shows
that the average conversion rate on a
typical landing page is about 6.6%,
but with just the right pre-sell alone,
you can expect to double that. So, this
works great with Google ads where people
are, you know, searching for their
problem like my dog won't stop barking
or I'm not getting any patients at my
dental practice. In this case, it's my
toddler won't sleep through the night.
And the reason this works so well with
ads is that pre-sale pages have been
shown to get 3.5% click-through rates
from ads versus the typical 2% for, you
know, those more direct sales pages. In
other words, a page like this that
promises information they can use today
is a way easier cell to get people to
click on in the first place than a page
that just promises to sell them
something. So, this also works great
with social media ads like on Facebook
or Instagram. You can even get people to
an article like this from Tik Tok or,
you know, if you're a B2B business,
LinkedIn would work great, too. Okay, so
now I want to go through this page
because it's not just an article.
There's a whole lot more happening
underneath the hood. Right at the top,
you're going to notice this headline is
not about the offer itself. It's just a
well-written article title. And Chad GBT
can really help you out here. So,
ideally, it should show a result that
you get in a short time frame without
having to, you know, do something
negative. So, this one says, "How I got
my toddler sleeping 11 hours a night in
just seven days without cry it out,"
which is apparently a typical method
that a lot of parents just don't want to
use. Then, we just have a really short
description of what's coming in the
article, especially what they'll be able
to accomplish after they read it. Then,
we have the author by line um with some
authority building. In this case, she is
a certified pediatric sleep consultant.
And now the layout here isn't what's
important. It can look like any blog
header that you've ever seen as long as
it has these elements. And a photo is
nice to have too. It just helps tell the
story visually and helps keep people
more interested in reading further. So
getting into the article itself here,
you always want to start with the
problem that your customers dealing with
right now. So this case we have three
months ago. I was sitting in my kitchen
holding my crying 2-year-old for the
fourth time that night. My husband has
passed out on the couch. Lucky him. And
I was running on maybe two hours of
sleep again. That one sentence does a
great job of bringing up the problem and
making it feel real enough to keep the
reader, you know, nodding along like,
"Yep, that's exactly where I am right
now, too." Then this next bit
establishes your authority as the author
so that the reader knows this is going
to be some kind of expert solution. As a
pediatric sleep consultant, I help
families with this exact problem every
single day. Then we get into, you know,
why what you've already tried probably
uh didn't work. And this is great
because it shifts the blame off of the
reader, which makes them feel like
you're on their side. You know, it's not
them, they just haven't found the right
thing yet. This is a classic sales
copyrightiting technique for a reason.
And notice how we include photos inside
the article here and there just to keep
them interested and moving down the
page. If this were all just text, people
would get bored really easily. And AI
image tools like Mjourney can make
anything you need in just a few seconds.
Um, these images were all made uh using
Mjourney. In fact, then we get into the
expert secrets or tips. So the trick
here is to give them a taste of the DIY
version without giving them absolutely
everything, right? You just want them to
see that you know what you're talking
about, but they may still have some
questions. Now, here is where we
smoothly transition from the DIY version
to the paid offer. So, I call this the
content to offer bridge. It basically
says something like, look, these steps
do work, but what do you do if you can't
get them working yourself? That's where
I come in. Then, we introduce the
solution, right? Our sleep consultant,
Sarah. And this last sentence here
states exactly what the offer is. It's a
personalized two-eek program where I
work with you directly to solve your
toddler's sleep challenges. We've got a
nice photo of her right here building
trust with her and her kids so we know
she knows what she's talking about. Then
we formally introduce the offer complete
with what it includes, followed by a
testimonial section again with real
customer photos and a short statement of
how many people that she's helped and
exactly what the results were. Then we
have that three-step section and the 10
reasons why section. We already talked
about these in the last landing page
example, so I won't go into it again
here, but again, these reasons should be
based on the research you do about ex
what your ideal customer actually cares
about before saying yes to an offer like
this. Then you just reverse engineer
their decision making criteria into
these 10 reasons. Then we have our call
to action section that really eases them
into it, saying that this is a no
pressure starting point to just remove
any hesitation. Then we have a short
money back guarantee section. Now, this
does an amazing job of just reversing
the risk and making people feel like
they're not taking a leap without a
safety net here, right? If it doesn't
work, they can get their money back. It
just makes it much easier for people to
say yes. And in my experience, very few
of them ever actually take you up on the
money back part unless your offer really
just isn't that good. And I know that's
not the case with you. So, um, anyway,
next we have the FAQ section
specifically to address those last
minute objections that people might have
uh before really feeling confident about
moving forward. And then we follow that
up with a final call to action section
that reiterates the offer and what
they're going to lose if they don't take
action. So that is super powerful
because they're going through the
problem right now. The last thing they
want is to stay stuck in that pain.
Okay, next up we have a completely
different landing page with a very
different purpose. Sometimes the best
offer that you can make as a business is
a free piece of valuable content
designed to build your email list.
Because believe it or not, email is
still the single best marketing channel
for sales. And even if you don't
personally think sales emails work on
you, I get comments like that all the
time. The stats don't lie. Email
marketing generates 174% more total
conversions than social media marketing.
And for every dollar you put into email
marketing, businesses typically get
about 36 to $44 back in return. But to
get those email addresses to you and
market to in the first place, you need a
landing page designed to sell your free
content, aka your lead magnet. So, let's
look at what's working really well right
now. Okay, so this is my own landing
page for my free masterclass training
video. I primarily get people here
directly from YouTube, but I've also run
ads to it in the past. Um, YouTube ads,
Instagram ads. I could run Google ads to
it if I wanted to. There are lots of
ways that you can get people over to a
page like this. And diving into my
numbers here, this puts about 30 to 40
new people on my list almost every
single day. And it converts at about
62%. And a typical page like this that
gets warm traffic to it like I do can
usually converts it closer to 45 to 50%.
So this one's actually doing a really
good job for me. And as you can see, it
is very simple. I start just by letting
people know what it is. It's a free
video master class. Then we have the
title, which should be very
outcomebased, right? Not just promising
what you'll learn, but rather what it's
going to do for you. In this case, it's
going to generate a website that sells
your services for you. Then we've got a
sub headline that just, you know, gives
a little bit more context, followed by a
more detailed description that dives a
little deeper into the promise of the
lead magnet. And again, we really want
this to be based on results and
outcomes, not just, you know, this is
what you're going to learn. It's really
important to know that people don't sign
up to learn stuff or for information.
They sign up for things like this to
achieve some kind of a transformation,
you know, cuz people can learn for free
on YouTube or podcasts without giving
over their email. So, you really have to
make it sound extra special. And we do
that by painting that after picture. you
know, we say it becomes your hardest
working salesperson. Um, turn your
website into a client attraction machine
that works for you around the clock.
Then we just have a really super simple
form that only asks for their first name
so that we can customize the emails that
we send and their email address. That's
it. And the call to action button that
emphasizes what they get, not just, you
know, submit or something generic like
that. Okay. Next, we have that benefits
bar that we saw earlier. Now, in this
case, I was able to include real
numbers, which is gold if you can. It
just shows in a few really quick hits.
Why this solution? How is it better than
other things that you might try? And
since this page is pulling in people
from a few different awareness levels, I
decided I wanted to include a really
short sales letter section. Remember, I
brought that up before. Here's kind of
an example of that. It just paints the
picture of the problem that they have,
which is a lack of clients due to a
website that's not properly optimized.
And then I have these bullets that are
meant to really kind of paint the
picture of the symptoms of the problem.
And this section doesn't really need to
be much longer than this. Um, especially
when we're talking about a free offer.
You know, generally speaking, the higher
price something is, the more you need to
kind of talk them into it with a longer
version of a section like this. But, you
know, in our case here, free lead
magnet, this length is perfect. Then we
have a simple invitation bar where I
just say, "Join me here." Followed by a
really clever section um that uses a lot
of curiosity and what we call open loops
to make people think, wait, there's an
actual, you know, framework for that and
whoa, what are the three things not to
include on my website? And do I have
them on mine? Open loops are basically
unfinished thoughts that create that
mental tension, right? So, your brain
naturally wants to close the loop. So,
these are all just teasing what they'll
learn in the video in a way that makes
them super curious to find out the
answer, which leads to more signups.
Then, I've just got a really direct call
to action bar, then a row of
testimonials from real people who have
already been through the training. So,
what you want here ideally is to hit on
a few different angles. You know, maybe
one's about the actual results they got.
one emphasizes uh how much easier this
made it or how much faster, right?
Because different people have different
reasons uh for wanting the same thing.
Then we do have a little about me
section. Um I find that this helps
establish some quick authority points,
especially if people aren't coming in
warm. Like if you're running social
media ads or something, uh they probably
would want to know why they should even
be listening to you. Now, I admit this
is probably a bit long, especially when
the people coming here are warmer
traffic, so part of me wants to shorten
it up, but as I said, this page is
actually working really well for me. So,
I'm probably just going to leave it
alone. Then, I just added another row of
testimonials because it's always good to
have as much social proof as we can.
Then, a very simple final call to action
block. So, whichever one of these
landing pages you want to steal for your
own business, all that's missing now is
the step-by-step part, right? How do you
actually make the page? Well, I've got
you covered in this start to finish
tutorial where you'll see how to turn
your offer into the perfect landing page
so that it's live and online in just
about an hour. So, click here for that,
including a special discount that I've
worked out with my favorite web host so
you can get started for just a few
bucks. So, click here and let's get you
all set


If there is one thing that I've learned
over the last 20 years of scaling
multiple companies, it's this.
Everything is downstream from lead
generation. If you can generate leads,
you can solve all the other problems
after that. But if you cannot generate
leads, you are dead in the water. And
today, I want to share with you my
multi-million dollar lead generation
system that has worked on agencies,
software companies, education and
training, coaching, consulting, and a
range of other businesses that I've been
involved with. Every single time I take
on board a new business project, I start
by setting up one of these online
assessments that just generates leads.
And off the back of the consistent
results that these get, we can scale up
from there. And it's going to totally
transform the number and the quality of
clients that come through your
business's front door. So, let's get
started on how to set up an online
assessment that creates leads like
nobody's business.
Landing Page
Step one for creating an online
assessment is to create a landing page
that really explains to people what the
online assessment is going to do for
them. Why would they take an online
assessment? The first part of the
landing page is the top of the landing
page. This is the first thing people see
when they're scrolling through their
phone. Now, they arrive at this landing
page and it has either one of two hooks.
Hook number one is called a frustration
hook. A frustration hook names the
frustration that people are
experiencing. So, it could be feeling
frustrated that you're not getting the
fitness results that you want even
though you work out every week. Feeling
frustrated that you're not getting
investment returns even though you
invest consistently every month. Feeling
frustrated that you have not been able
to scale up your marketing even though
you're willing to invest in ads. Right?
So, anything that is the frustration,
feeling frustrated that blank happens
even though you're doing this very
powerful frustration hook. The second
one is a results hook. And the way I
like to do a results hook is a readiness
sentence. Are you ready to run your
first marathon? Are you ready to have
the relationship of your dreams? Are you
ready to protect your business from a
cyber security threat? Right? So,
anything that you can help people get as
a result, if you ask people, are they
ready for that result? They're going to
say, "Oh, I'm not sure if I'm ready. I
want to take this assessment to find
out." Now, the subheading of the hook
says, "Answer 15 questions to find out
why you're experiencing this frustration
and what to do about it." So the
subheading directs people to take the
assessment, answer 15 questions so they
can find out if they're ready or if they
can deal with this frustration. So the
next part of the landing page is called
the value proposition. The way to do a
value proposition is to tell people to
take this assessment so that we can
measure and improve three key areas. So
let's say you're doing a sleep
assessment. Are you ready to get 7 hours
or more of really high quality deep
sleep? You would then have the value
proposition. Answer these 15 questions
so that we can measure and improve your
sleep environment, your sleep routine,
and your sleep nutrition or whatever it
is. So, you're going to give people a
value proposition. You're going to say,
"We're going to measure and improve
three key things, and you're going to
list those three things, and those are
going to be three things that people
would love to achieve along the way to a
better result." So, that's the value
proposition. When people hear a powerful
hook and a good value proposition, they
immediately want to know whether it's
credible. It sounds almost too good to
be true. So they want to know who are
you? What's your background? What
research have you done? So under the
credibility section, we need to say who
created this which is you and your bio.
What have you done in the past? So
what's your background and the research
that you've done? So you might be able
to quote some statistics, some figures.
You might be able to say 85% of people
struggle with X, Y, and Zed. You might
be able to say a recent Harvard
University study found that 15% of
people are achieving X, Y, and Zed. This
number could be dramatically improved,
right? So, who are you? What have you
done in the past? What research have you
done in order to create this assessment?
Then the final thing is called a call to
action, a CTA. And a call to action,
what we want to do here is a really
powerful call to action. And we want to
cover a few key things here. We want to
say start the quiz cuz that's the next
step. It only takes 3 minutes to
complete. It's completely free. and you
get immediate recommendations on how you
can improve. That combination is very
powerful as a call to action. Now, if
you get this right, you will have 20 to
40%
of people who hit that landing page
going ahead and starting the quiz. And
that is going to be a massive lead
Questionnaire
generator for you. So, part two of this
online assessment lead generation
strategy is the quiz questions. This is
where we're going to find out a lot of
information about every single person
who's signaling interest for you. Now,
this questionnaire is actually going to
have three parts to it. Part one is
where you're going to ask them their
name, their email address automatically.
We're going to get their location
because of their IP address. And you're
going to give them the opportunity to
enter their phone number, but you're not
going to make it mandatory to do that.
So, the two things they have to enter in
order to start the quiz is their name
and their email address. The location
will be picked up by the system, and the
phone number will be optional. So, the
contact information is the first things
that we want to capture. Then we want to
go into the first 10 questions. Now
these 10 questions, we're going to call
these the best practices questions. So
the best practices questions is we're
going to ask people if they're doing 10
things that they should be doing. So if
this scorecard was about uh sleep, we
might ask them if they get to bed on
time at the same time, if they're using
too many screens before bed. If this
assessment was about health and fitness
and losing weight, do they track their
calories? Do they work out three or four
times a week? Whatever you consider to
be the best practices, you're going to
ask them 10 questions that allude to how
many of these best practices they've
been able to say yes to or no to. And
that's what's going to give them their
score, which we'll get to soon. So,
you've got to come up with 10 best
practices that you think people should
be doing if they're doing all the right
things, and that's going to inform the
score. But now, we're going to add five
more questions that are going to be
really powerful questions for you to be
able to make more sales. So, here's the
big five questions that I want you to
ask that allow you to qualify your leads
and make more sales. Question number one
is which best describes your current
situation. So, you might give people uh
four or five options to choose from. I'm
a student. Uh I'm in my first 5 years of
my career. Uh I'm a manager. I'm a
senior leader. I'm an executive. Or uh
I've never run a marathon before. Uh
I've run one to three marathons. I'm a
seasoned marathon runner. Whatever is
their current situation, you want to
know how they describe it. The next
question is which describes your desired
outcome that you would like to achieve
in the next 90 days. And then you give
them a list of things that they want to
achieve in the next 90 days. And ask
them which is the most important desired
outcome for you to achieve in the next
90 days. That gives them the opportunity
to tell you what is the number one thing
that's driving their decisions. They
might say, "I want to lose weight or I
want to achieve my first 7 hours worth
of deep sleep." Right? whatever it is,
they're going to say that's the outcome
that I want in the next 90 days.
Question number three is, what is the
obstacle that you think is stopping you?
Or what have you tried that hasn't
worked in the past? And you'll give them
a list of three or four things to choose
from so they can select what they think
is the biggest obstacle to their
success. The fourth question is, which
solution do you think would suit you
best?
And you could say, I want uh education
and training. I want one-to-one
coaching. Uh I want software. Uh, I want
someone to do it all for me. Right? So,
you can give them some potential
solutions. Now, the benefit of this
question is that it implies what they're
willing to spend. Someone who only wants
a book is probably going to spend $10 or
$20. Someone who says, "I want it all
done for me," they're probably thinking
$10,000 to $20,000. So, the solution
that people have in mind will tell you a
little bit about their budget that they
have in mind. And the fifth question is,
"Is there anything else that you think
we need to know about?" Now, this is an
openbox question and it allows them to
type anything into the box that they
want. And the craziest thing is that a
lot of times people will tell you what's
driving their decision or they'll tell
you useful information that helps you to
make a sale. I've had people put into
that box, uh, I've already read your
book and I want to get started or I have
a budget but I have to spend it by the
end of the month. Right? Incredible
stuff that people will put into that box
that is incredibly helpful. If they've
answered all of those 14 other
questions, they're going to give you
some really good relevant information if
they fill in that question as well. So
those are the 15 questions that we want
people to answer. And when they do that,
we can give them what we call their
Dynamic Results
dynamic results.
So the reason we call it dynamic results
is because this entire results page can
completely change depending on how they
answered the questions. So for example,
we could have a little speedometer here
that tells people how they performed.
You got a 75% out of 100%. We could have
a thermometer that tells people that
they're cold, warm, or hot. Right? So we
could put anything we want here as a
result. And we can tell people,
"Congratulations, you scored really
well." We could say, "Oh, no. You've got
a lot of room to improve." We could say,
"Well done. You've got strong
foundations, but plenty of room to
improve." We can change the content that
goes here depending on how people
answered the questions. So, here's what
we want to have. Number one, we want to
have the big reveal. So, the big reveal
is the overall result. This is how you
did in general. Then, we want to have
three insights. So as a result of how
you answered the question, what are
three things that I want you to know?
Then finally, we want to have some next
steps. Uh and those next steps would be
completely different depending upon how
people answered the questions. If
someone's answered the questions in a
way that's highly qualified, you might
want to offer them a one-to-one meeting.
If someone is somewhere in the middle,
you might want to offer them a group
presentation, a group event. Maybe if
someone has answered the question so
that you know that they are absolutely
wrong for your business, you may just
want to give them some content. So you
might send them to a video episode or a
podcast episode or you might recommend a
book. But this can change depending on
how people answer the questions. And
then finally down the bottom you want to
have all your contact information, maybe
your social media links and all of that
sort of stuff so that if people want to
bounce around off that page, they can
leave that open but they can also open
up other pages. So you definitely want
to have your website there as well. So
this basically is a end to-end system
where they discover that there is an
assessment. They then answer 15
questions and then they get their
dynamic results with specialized next
steps based on how they answered those
questions. This is incredibly powerful
because you can see the quality of the
leads that come in. When this captures
all of the leads, you actually get to
see how people answered all the
questions. You can see how they scored.
You can see where they are. You can see
whether they've put real contact
information in. You can see the
recommended next step. It's all laid out
in the dashboard for you. It's
incredible. Now, this entire system
might seem like it's an incredibly
difficult and complex system to set up,
Get An Automated System
but it's all completely automated for
you at scoreapp.com. I'm the co-founder
of that software company, and I've put
all of my best thinking into one place.
We've got 150 templates that are based
on this strategy. We've got a
downloadable book called Scorecard
Marketing. We've got online courses that
explain exactly how to do it. And we've
got an amazing customer success team
that will just get on a call with you
and help you to set this up. It could
not possibly be easier. In fact, most
people get set up in about 10, 20, 30
minutes and then they're ready to go.
Either way, the juice is worth the
squeeze because this thing produces so
many high-quality leads. So, there'll be
a link in the description below so you
can get set up on scoreapp.com as well.
So, the one question that everyone asks
me once they see this system is, "How do
I send people to this landing page? How
do I get more clicks? How do I get more
conversions? How do I send paid traffic?
How do I send organic traffic to this
landing page?" So, let me tell you, I've
just created a video before this one
that answers that exact question. I'm
going to link to that video in the
description below, and that video talks
exactly step by step how to start small
and then scale big for getting attention
into landing page traffic. So, you're
going to see the link to that video in
the description below. As I said at the
beginning, everything is downstream from
lead generation. If you can master lead
generation, everything else comes off
the back of that. You'll be able to get
more sales. You'll be able to hire the
right people. You'll be able to scale
your business if you can get this lead
generation sorted once and for all. I
hope you've enjoyed this video and I
hope your business is successful.


Everyone says your website should bring
in leads, but no one tells you how to
know if it's working or if it's been
sabotaging your ability to get clients
all along. Look at these two homepages.
These sites offer the same service,
pretty similar branding, nearly
identical copy. And yet, homepage B
converts three times better than
homepage A. Why? What actually makes the
difference is the structure, the layout
itself. After a decade of creating
websites for service businesses, I've
discovered that the most effective
layouts strike a perfect balance.
They're familiar enough to be intuitive
and easy to use, but they're unique
enough to stand out. In this video, I'm
revealing five brand new homepage
layouts that are generating more leads
than anything else right now for service
businesses like yours. You'll see
exactly what makes them different, which
additional elements they include that
boost conversions, and how to choose the
perfect one for your specific business
type. But before we get to the layouts,
we need to focus on the one section
that's going to give you the biggest
return on your effort. What some people
call above the fold, but around here, we
usually just call it the hero section.
It's just that first screen that
visitors see at the very top of your
homepage, and it has to instantly show
what you offer, how it helps them, and
how they can get it. If people can't
immediately see what you do or why
you're better than your competition,
they're going to bounce before they
scroll any further down your page. So,
getting your hero section right puts you
80% of the way to conversion success.
For that very important reason, we're
going to focus completely on the hero
section in all of these layouts. So,
Hero Section
what we're looking at right now, this is
the very most basic typical uh hero
section that you'll see on a lot of
websites. This whole gray area is
supposed to be an image. Then we have
the headline, sub headline, and then
call to action button. And honestly,
it's not that bad. There's nothing like
terrible about this, but at the end of
the day, we are putting text on top of
an image, and that can go sideways real
fast. So, see what I mean? Like, this
image would have to be planned very
carefully so that this doesn't go across
the guy's face. And then as the browser
size changes, that's really hard to keep
track of, which is why this is like a
newer uh standard treatment that you'll
see a lot now where the image is over
here and the text is over here. And it's
very important if you're going to go
with something like this, you want to
make sure that these are not transposed,
right? You don't want the picture over
here and the text over here for the
simple reason that this is going to get
more attention on the left. They've done
countless studies just seeing like where
people look on a web page. And the words
are the really important part, right?
The image is just the window dressing to
help you tell your story. But the
headline and the sub headline, that's
what tells people what they're really
going to get. So, this is okay. It's a
step in the right direction, but I'm
going to show you the new layouts now
that do a little bit of a better job and
are going to make your site feel more
unique. So, let's start with the first
one. You can see right away that it's
got something different going on, right?
So, we don't have any text overlapping
anything. The text is all above the
image, which is a good hierarchy because
it really just lets people know that
this is the really important stuff that
they should be looking at. We still have
a good call to action button, place for
the image. Here's where things get a
little more interesting. And we're
adding to this, not just in a layout
way, but we're actually adding content
that's going to help you sell your
services. So the first thing we have
here is basically just a call out where
you can add any kind of a statistic. How
many people you've helped, how many
fivestar reviews you have, how much
money you save your clients. Anything
you want could go there. And then down
here we have basically these are meant
to be little results that you can say
that you get for your clients. So right
away we're sweetening the pot a little
bit. So it's one thing to see kind of
the wireframe just to see the layout,
but let's see what this could really
look like for a business. All right,
check it out. So, if this is a company
that does, you know, ghostwriting
services for, you know, experts so they
can, you know, get more bookings and
stuff, this is definitely a very modern
look and I think it sells the service
pretty well. So, we've got a great
results focused headline and then this
section here gives more context about
exactly what we do. So, this tells a
story of what you're going to get and
then this is like, but here's how we do
it. We help you, you know, write a book
that sells your expertise, all that good
stuff. Then we've got a nice call out
here of we've done this for 150 plus
coaches like you. We have a great hero
image of someone who's actually, you
know, she's now got a book and now she's
got a speaking deal, right? So, it's
like it tells that story visually and we
have the three results, more clients,
clear authority, bigger opportunities.
But that's just one. Let's check out our
next one. Okay, so this one I love. If
you have um a need to show different
kinds of images, this is great if you
have, you know, different client avatars
that you help um and you want to show
that you've got that diversity, right?
You help men, you help women, you help
older people, younger people. It helps
to be able to show the differences there
because ideally speaking, you do want to
have that happy customer photo. These
images should never be of you and your
team. It should be about your clients.
So, this gives you spots for two or I
mean you could technically make this a
third photo if you wanted to, but I like
having that call out of a nice
statistic. It's just some good social
proof right off the bat. And here's all
the usual content over here. And then
down here, we also have those positive
results that you can show. This is also
great if you're any kind of a designer
or a contractor, anything where you want
to show physical samples of your work.
You know, this lets you do a couple
rather than just one. So, let's go ahead
and see what this could look like in
practice. Okay, so we've got a speech
therapist for kids. Now, what I like
about this is we've got a picture of a
really small child and then one who
looks like she's maybe in middle school
or high school, which shows that we
don't just specialize in, you know, if
you're a toddler, will help you if
you're young, but we can also help you
when you're a little older. So, it gets
the point across really nicely. And
we've shown like how many people we've
helped and again just all the different
results. So, and then you may be
wondering for something like this, like
if it were to shrink down for mobile.
Well, the thing you would want to do for
mobile is probably just pick one of
these images and then go with that as
your main hero that would show on
mobile. But on desktop, you can you have
more breathing room to kind of show more
photos. So, it would basically be, you
know, the image maybe on top and then
this over here. And it would just kind
of lay one on top of the other. It would
be stacked versus next to each other.
Okay. Okay, so now this one I like a
lot, but you have to use it very
carefully because if you remember my big
gripe with the basic layout is you it's
hard to have text on top of an image. So
what you want to do, you would only want
to use this if you're not going to have
like a closeup of a person's face,
right? This is great if you are again a
contractor or something where you're
you're more showing like physical space
versus like a person or even if it's
like a bunch of people like a group
shot. This could work out nicely for
that. So, we've got a place for an
image, a nice long image. Then, we've
got this box laying on top of it where
we've got your three results. We've
already discussed that. And then we've
got a different kind of social proof
treatment here. We have spots for, you
know, three. Doesn't have to be three.
It could be as many of these as you
want. That makes sense and you have room
for. These would be images of actual
clients you've helped. you'd have a
fivestar emoji and you just say, you
know, how many people we've helped or
how many fivestar reviews we have,
something like that. So, let's check it
out in practice. Okay, so remember how I
said it's good if we're showing like
physical space? So, I thought this would
be great for a video background. So,
this is a company that uh builds outdoor
spaces and gardening and all that stuff
for people. So, we've got that cool
video background here. And then we just
have a nice like black overlay on top of
it so that you can actually still read
all of this. You definitely want to make
sure you knock it back a little bit
because otherwise this could be a very
busy background. Then we have this
little box right here. I've just made it
into rounded edges. Easy enough to do
that. And then, yeah, we got our three
results and we have our social proof
element right here. Okay, so this one's
fun. This is pretty much inspired by
those like bento boxes, right? like it's
it's pretty popular in web design right
now because everything's got its own
little container which can be a lot of
fun. It can also get away from you a
little bit if you don't really know what
you're doing color-wise. So, this is one
that I would consider to be slightly
more advanced and I probably wouldn't do
it unless you really have a good color
palette picked out and you know how to
use color correctly. So, it's just a
cool treatment. I mean, it's got all the
same elements we've already talked
about. We're just presenting them in a
new way. Okay, so we've got the image
over here with our results, our social
proof here, and this is a nice big box.
So, this could also be if you wanted
just to have one person image. This
could be a nice mini testimonial right
here. So, there's a few things you could
do with it. So, let's see what this
could actually look like. So, yeah, I
imagine this for a personal trainer. So,
we've got a nice just dark background
with these kind of gradient uh boxes
over here and here. But, do you see how
I mean how the colors could get away
from you? Like sometimes it can be hard
to know like what color to make this and
what color to make the background and
all that stuff. So if you're a designer
or if you're super confident in your
color choices, this is a great one to go
with. It's very modern. And the other
cool thing is when we talk about mobile
design, like if this were to shrink down
for mobile, it's really easy just to
stack all of these elements on top of
each other because it's so modular. And
LaunchPad
here's the part I haven't told you yet.
Every single one of these
high-converting layouts are included as
readyto-use templates in my program, the
profitable website launchpad. And right
now is the perfect time to join because
I'm having my twice a year special
enrollment week where you can get in for
$100 less than the normal price. But the
launchpad is so much more than these
beautiful, highly converting templates.
It all starts with dialing in the
messaging that your ideal client needs
to hear, understand, and believe before
they'll ever decide they want to work
with you. Then I'm going to show you how
to turn that raw sales message into
every single line of text for your
entire website. And in the past, even
with all my templates and frameworks,
getting your website strategy, copy, and
design just right could take most of my
students four to 6 weeks to finish. But
this new version for 2025 is a whole new
ball game. I've added AI throughout the
entire process. And no, I'm not talking
about generic chat GPT here. This is a
really precise AI assistant that I
personally trained on over 15 years of
website copywriting formulas and
conversion strategies. Then when the
content creation phase is complete,
that's where the templates come in. So
you get 10 fully customizable drag and
drop site kits that are perfectly
aligned with all of the content that
we're going to create section for
section. Just watch how quickly we can
drop this content into one of these
templates. Just add in the new text,
images, fonts, and colors. And look at
that transformation. In just a couple
clicks, we've got a professionally
designed, strategically laidout hero
section that's already ready to convert.
And just so you can see how customizable
these templates are, this is the same
template styled three different ways.
And yes, I do show you how to get the
best images, color combinations, and
fonts, so you can have something that
looks as great as these. And they're all
pre-optimized for mobile views, too. All
that to say, you can now complete your
entire website in just a few weeks from
start to finish, just 30 to 60 minutes
at a time. And it's really important to
know these aren't just basic websites.
These are strategic client generating
machines like the ones that I just
showed you. But look, I get it. Maybe
you're thinking, "That sounds great,
Wes, but I'm not techy or I just don't
have the time." Well, that's exactly why
I've structured the profitable website
launchpad to be completely step by step
and why it did most of the pre-work for
you so that AI can help you get launched
really fast. And here's the best part.
You're never alone in this process.
Every single student gets 90 full days
of small group coaching by me and my
team in weekly live Q&A calls. That
works out to about 12 sessions where you
can get direct feedback from me on your
website. Stuck on your homepage
headline? Not sure if your design is
working or just want confirmation that
you're on the right track? All you got
to do is show up to the live sessions
and we can work through it together in
real time. Think about what that means
for a second. So rather than spending
$5,000 minimum on a professional team to
build your website for you, and that's
on the low end, you're getting
everything you need to create a
highconverting website yourself. Plus,
Special Enrollment Week

What's the difference between a brochure
type landing page that makes no money
and one that generates over a million
dollars in revenue? After building and
testing over 300 landing pages for just
about every type of service business you
can imagine, I can tell you it's not
fancy design or expensive software. In
this video, I'm going to show you the
exact sevenstep formula that transformed
hundreds of service business landing
pages from silent ghost towns into
client generating machines. Why using
these specific elements will give you a
massive advantage over your competitors
and what you can do right now to apply
these proven psychological triggers that
make potential clients feel that urgent
need to contact you even when they
thought they were just browsing. But
before we do that, we do need to get
crystal clear about what the purpose of
a landing page is because that's the
secret sauce. Think about your website
for a second. You know, for most service
businesses, it's kind of like a Costco
filled with every piece of information a
potential client might possibly want.
Your services, your about page, your
blog, your testimonials, all crammed
onto different shelves and displays
throughout a bunch of disorganized
pages. Then whenever a visitor lands
there, they have to like fight their way
through an overwhelming warehouse of
information with no clear idea of what
they should look at first or where they
should go next. But what if your offer
was presented more like an Apple store?
Instead, the moment you walk in,
everything about the experience is very
intentional. The clean open layout, the
careful spotlight on just a few key
products. The way that staff guides you
to exactly what you need without
overwhelming you with options. The
entire store is designed to not just
look good, but to create that seamless
journey that leads to a purchase, all
while letting you believe that you're
the one in control. That's the power of
psychology. And a landing page works
exactly the same way. It's just a single
focused page designed with one specific
purpose to convert a visitor into a
lead. While a typical landing page might
convert 1 to 2% of visitors, a really
wellthoughtout landing page can convert
5 to 10% or even higher. So that's the
power of removing the distractions and
creating a clear path forward for your
potential customers. Have you ever
noticed that some landing pages just
feel kind of off, like they're trying to
talk to everyone all at once? That is
because most service business owners
make a huge mistake from the very start.
They make landing pages that try to
catch way too many fish at once. Here's
what happens. You think, "I don't want
to miss out on anyone who might need
what I offer." So, you then make your
message super generic, kind of like
handing out flyers in a parking lot. You
know, you might get a few polite takers,
but let's be real, those flyers are
getting crumpled and tossed before they
even buckle their seat belt. The first
Step 1 Understand Your Audience
step to a high-converting landing page
is just getting really crystal clear on
exactly who you're talking to. I'm not
just talking about basic demographics
like homeowners or business
professionals. I mean, really
understanding their specific problems,
what they actually want, and the exact
words that they use to describe what
they're looking for. And here's why this
matters so much. When you truly
understand your audience, every other
decision gets easier, right? Your
headline practically writes itself. Your
benefits are obvious. Your design
choices make sense. Everything falls
into place. Take a look at this landing
page right here. See how the headline is
a perfect example of just understanding
what your audience wants. They don't
care about social media management or
LinkedIn optimization strategies. Those
are just features. what they actually
want is more reach for their company on
LinkedIn. This headline speaks directly
to that desire, showing that they
understand exactly what their target
audience is looking for. I've seen this
play out hundreds of times. Service
businesses that target the right
audience in their landing pages convert
two to three times better than the ones
that just have generic messaging trying
to appeal to everybody. That's the
difference between 200 conversions and
600 conversions, which means three times
more leads from the exact same amount of
Step 2 Write a Powerful Headline
traffic. Now, you might have the most
amazing service in the world, but if
your headline doesn't grab attention
immediately, nobody's going to stick
around to find out. Generic headlines
waste the most valuable real estate on
your page. Cuz here's a harsh truth. You
have about 3 seconds to grab a visitor's
attention before they hit the back
button. So, in those precious few
seconds, your headline really needs to
do a lot of heavy lifting. But what
makes a headline powerful? It's not
about being clever or creative with it,
it's just about being clear and
relevant. Your headline needs to say
exactly what you offer and speak
directly to what your visitor wants. And
I have the data to back this up. You
know, a strong headline can boost
conversion rates by up to 300%. Think
about that. Same page, same offer, same
everything. But a better headline can
triple your results. Let me give you a
real world example. So look at this
headline. It's about time. What does
that even mean? This landing page is for
a calendar app and the sub headline says
it's the next generation of calendar for
professionals. But there's absolutely no
indication of why I should even care.
It's trying way too hard to be clever
rather than just telling me what I get.
Now compare that to this one. Generate
and publish your site with AI in
seconds. See the difference? This
headline's crystal clear about what you
get a website, how you get it, AI, and
how long it takes? Seconds. It literally
can't get better than that. So, within 3
seconds, I know exactly what they're
offering and why I might want it. Now
Step 3 Use Benefit Focused Copy
that your message is clear and your
visitors know what you do, you need to
let them know what they're going to get
when they hire you. Right? This is where
I see one of the biggest mistakes that
service businesses make on their landing
pages. endless lists of features without
explaining what clients actually get out
of them. I call this the feature dump
and it leaves a ton of money on the
table. Why? Well, it's because clients
don't really buy services or features.
They buy results, right? They don't care
about your proprietary 12step process.
They care about what that process will
do for them. This is where benefit
focused copy comes in. So, for every
feature of your service, you need to
translate it into a benefit by asking
yourself, "So what?" Right? For example,
if you're a house cleaner, don't just
say, "We use eco-friendly cleaning
products," the feature. Say, "You'll
enjoy a spotless home without harsh
chemicals that make your kids and pets
sick." Look at this example here.
Instead of just listing branded
experience as a feature, they've
explained the benefit. Stand out from
competitors by putting your brand front
and center. This immediately shows the
client what they'll get. You know, a
competitive advantage that makes their
business more
recognizable, not just what the feature
is. The most powerful landing pages
connect emotionally by showing how your
service improves your client's life.
When you make that one change alone, the
results are pretty dramatic. You know,
benefit focused copy usually doubles
engagement compared to just plain old
feature lists. Remember, people buy
based on emotion and they justify it
with logic. So, your copy needs to tap
into both, but the emotional benefits
are really what drive the most action.
Speaking of driving people to action,
have you ever opened up Netflix or Hulu
and spent 30 minutes scrolling through
all the endless options only to give up
and watch The Office again? That
paralysis is exactly what happens on
landing pages with multiple calls to
action, lowering your conversion rates
by up to
266%. That's pretty hard to take. That's
what she said. The solution is
surprisingly simple. Create one obvious
next step that stands out visually.
Maybe it's get your free quote or book
your consultation. Whatever makes sense
for your business as long as it's not
just a vague contact us button, right?
Pick one. Make sure it's clear and
impossible to miss. Take a look at this
landing page. See how clean and focused
it is. There's one clear call to action
that says, "Schedule a consultation."
When you click that button, you know
exactly what's going to happen next.
There's no navigation menu, no social
links, no distractions, just the call to
action button in the hero section and
again in the header. One of the easiest
ways to improve your conversion rate is
just to remove all the navigation links
from your landing page. That one simple
change alone can double your signups
just by keeping visitors focused on the
the one action that you actually want
them to take. Because, you know,
eliminating distractions creates a much
more clear path to conversion. Every
single link that isn't your primary
called action here is just a potential
exit point that could cost you the sale.
Step 5 Build Trust
Let's face it, people are constantly hit
with ads, special offers, discounts,
over-the-top promises, and even just
straight up scams. So, they've naturally
become desensitized to all that noise
and they're less trusting of what they
see on the internet, whether it's from
ads on social media or your email
newsletter or even the promises you make
on your website. None of it matters if
they don't believe what you're saying.
So, your landing page needs to overcome
this doubt. And that's where trust
elements come in. Think about it. 83% of
people trust reviews more than
traditional marketing. That means what
others say about you is way more
important than what you say about
yourself. So, how do you use this? By
strategically using testimonials,
credentials, and guarantees. Even if
you're just starting out, these things
can build instant credibility on your
landing page. For example, specific
testimonials with real names and photos
can increase conversion rates by up to
34%. That is because they provide social
proof. You're basically showing evidence
that others have already chosen you and
had a really good experience. But
testimonials are just the beginning
here. You can also show logos of clients
or professional associations you belong
to. Add a personal guarantee that
removes risk. Display relevant
credentials or awards and then use trust
badges in your forms to make people feel
safe sharing their information. All
these elements work together to build
enough trust that makes visitors feel
comfortable taking the next steps with
Step 6 Clean Design
you. Have you ever clicked on an ad only
to land on a page that looked like this?
Cluttered, overly busy designs overwhelm
your visitors and kill your conversion
rates. Design matters more than most
service businesses realize. Research
shows that 94% of first impressions are
design related. In less time than it
takes to blink, visitors judge your
professionalism based on how your page
looks. But don't get confused here. It's
not just about how pretty your website
looks. The key is really creating a
visually organized page with a clear
hierarchy. So, this means using plenty
of white space, choosing easyto- read
fonts, keeping your colors consistent,
and including relevant images that
support your message. Good design isn't
just about looks. It's about guiding the
eye strategically through your page. So,
when elements are properly sized and
emphasized, visitors naturally are going
to flow from your headline to your
benefits, then to your call to action.
I've seen clean, professional designs
increase conversions by 20 to 50%
compared to cluttered ones. And the best
part is you don't need to be a designer
to create a clean page. In fact, simpler
is almost always better when it comes to
conversions. Now, this next tip might
Step 7 Speed
seem kind of technical, but it's super
important, and that's making sure that
your page loads quickly and looks good
on your desktop and mobile. Most people
that come to your website are probably
doing it from their phones. So, if your
landing page doesn't look good or
function well on them, you could be
losing half of your leads before they
ever even see your offer. Speed is just
as important. So, if your website takes
longer than a second to load, you're
already losing about 7% of the traffic,
and it only gets worse the longer your
page takes to load. People have zero
patience for slow sites. So, if it
doesn't come up immediately, they're
just going to hit the back button and
try your next competitor instead. So,
how do we fix it? The good news is you
don't need to be techy to make your page
mobile friendly and fast. Most of the
modern website builders today like
Elementor, they handle mobile
responsiveness automatically. And there
are some really simple steps that anyone
can take to make your site faster, like
just optimizing your image sizes and
keeping your page design pretty
straightforward. And if things get
really bad, you can switch to a faster
hosting provider that offers a CDN
that'll turn things around for you. I
like Hostinger for that. And you can get

right away and it looks great on every
device, you create a seamless experience
that keeps your visitors engaged with
your message instead of being, you know,
distracted and frustrated with technical
issues. Even when you have all these
